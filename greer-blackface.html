This experience has taught me that just because something feels right at the beginning, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s right for us in the end.

Four months before The Bachelor season 27 premiered, Greer came under fire after a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> user posted a series of tweets from her in 2016 defending an incident of blackface. The incident involved a photo taken of a white teenage girl in blackface at an off-campus party. The girl was a sophomore student at Lamar High School in Houston, Texas, a local high school near Greer’s hometown. The photo showed a white teenage girl with black paint o her face wearing a T-shirt featuring tupac. The party was organized by a secret social club called Wichaka, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">KPRC</a>. “I thought it was blackface and I was immediately offended,” senior student Ogechi Anene told KPRC at the time. “She was supposed to be Tupac. If you were to impersonate a Black person even as a costume I don’t think it’s appropriate to wear black paint on your skin.”</p><p>In a series of since-deleted <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">tweets</a> posted on Reddit, Greer defended the student. “The students involved didn’t even know what black face was so my point exactly. It wasn’t an intentional racist act,” Greer wrote at the time. “She did not paint herself black because she felt superior to black [people]. Putting white powder on your face isn’t okay either. That didn’t make the news did it? I apologize if this offended you but you must understand it was not initially supposed to be perceived that way at all.”</p><p>After The Bachelor season 27 premiere, Greer apologized for her past tweets in a series of Instagram Stories. “The journey to love is filled with lessons and these lessons are also made on our journey of growth. In my past, I have made some uneducated, ignorant and frankly, wrong comments on my social media accounts,” she wrote. “In particular, I used misguided arguments on Twitter to defend a student who dressed in Blackface as Tupac for Halloween.”</p><p>She continued, “I am deeply sorry to those I have hurt, especially those within the Black community, not because these screenshots have resurfaced, but because I ever shared these harmful opinions at all. Time and age do not excuse my actions, but this is not a reflection of who I am today.” She concluded, “I do not stand by or condone the damaging opinions and behaviors I share during that stage of my life and will forever regret making those offensive remarks.”</p><p>Greer also apologized for the blackface tweets at The Bachelor season 27 “Women Tell All” in March 2023. “I’ve been wanting to address this. I don’t want to sweep this under the rug. I will say, I am nervous right now to talk about it but I really do want to address it,” she said. “What I failed to mention in my apology was that happened was racist. It’s not about the intent. It’s about the impact. This acquaintance of mine that I knew, performing blackface, was racist. Me defending it was racist. My ignorance was racist. I’m so ashamed. I’m deeply sorry that I hurt the Black community. I can’t go back in time. All I can do is try to be better now and try to be better in my future.”</p><p>Greer also explained what she learned from Dr. Kira Banks, the founder of Institution of Healing Justice and Equity, who was invited to the “Women Tell All” special. “After meeting with Dr. Banks, she brought to my intention that it’s so important to be open-minded. It’s so important to question things and ask and not do without thinking,” Greer said. “Before you do, think. Before you say something you could say something that could hurt someone, hurt someone else. Do your research. I looked up lectures. I really wanted to dive into the history of blackface and understand why it was wrong, why it was offensive. The research I was able to do, I realized it was a symbolism for dehumanizing the Black community. What I said was wrong, what I said defending that girl was racist. I want to take that accountability. I don’t want to excuse it.”</p><p>After the “Women Tell All” special, several of Greer Bachelor season 27 co-stars responded to her blackface apology.&nbsp;“You know, this is one of those things where as much as it’s like a relationship, it’s also almost a social experience. I got to meet Greer without social media. I didn’t look up her Instagram or anything for that fact. I only knew the person that she brought, and she was nothing but the utmost of respectful to me,” said Aly Jacobs, who came in eighth on The Bachelor season 27. “I saw her be very respectful to other girls. Her and I bonded a lot and got to know each other. We’re from the same city, we have the same birthday, so we were cool.”</p><p>Aly told People that it was “hurtful to hear and see the things” Greer tweeted about, however, she “respected” the fact that Greer” always faced it head on.” She continued, “She didn’t wait for things to come out, she told us immediately when we got back what it was. And you know, I respect and appreciate that she could have the conversation that she had tonight because I’m sure that was very difficult. I respect and appreciate that she could also acknowledge that she’s not the same person that she was seven years ago, and I hope that that’s like, courage for someone else to instead of hide behind your mistakes, call them out. Say what it is and move past it. That just leaves room for a lot of growth and maturity.” She added, “I just think we all have a lot more learning to do and clearly, she’s on the journey to do that. And so I have a lot of respect for her — at least the person that she is today — and glad that she can look back and say that’s a different person and not recognize them.”</p><p>Kylee Russell, who was eliminated in week five on The Bachelor season 27, told People that she believed Greer “owned up to her actions and what she’s done.” She continued, “She even took it upon herself to have the conversation with the doctor,” she said. “I think it just starts with taking that first step, and she did. And that’s all we can ask. Do I hope her mindset has changed and she is more conscious in the future? Absolutely. Do I know that’s gonna happen? Not necessarily, but I’m glad she took that first step.”</p><p>Host Jesse Palmer also told People that he respected Greer for addressing her blackface tweets “head-on.” “Look, nobody on the show condones any of those tweets that she had,” he said. “But I think everybody on the show is really proud of her for taking it head-on and wanting to have the opportunity to address everything, and we’re also really, really thankful for Dr. Banks too for helping guide that conversation and in helping with that as well.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zach-Shallcross-The-Bachelor.jpg><p>After The Bachelor season 27 premiered, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Sun</a> in February 2023 that Greer made an “offensive” comment toward Lekha Ravi, a 29-year-old financial advisor from Miami, Florida, during night one of The Bachelor season 27, which was filmed but didn’t make it on air. “Lekha was talking to the women about how she wanted to do something different for her first impression,” the insider said. “She wanted to present Zach with a flower garland, which is tradition in her culture. “Greer then said to her, ‘Oh, you’re Indian? I thought you were white. You look white.'”</p><p>The source noted that Lekha was “shocked and thrown off by the comment.” The insider continued, “She didn’t know what to say back to Greer.” Lekha, who was born in Chennai, India, and moved to the United States when she was seven years old, confirmed she wanted to give Zach a flower garland in an Instagram post before The Sun’s report. (The limo entrance that was filmed was her licking Zach’s ear.) “I am totally over the lick, and don’t regret it,” she wrote. “But initially what I wanted to do was that in my culture, you put a garland of flowers over each other’s neck, when the couple gets married and the flowers represent beauty, happiness, and excitement.” She continued, “I wanted to put it on [Zach] and have him put it on me. I felt like I did what I could. You know it’s a first step forward to, our community being represented more.”</p><p>In another post, Lekha reflected on her time on The Bachelor. “Obviously things didn’t turn out anything quite as expected and I had no idea what I signed up for, but I took a chance and leap of faith and I’m glad you guys got to see my personality and character shine through on screen,” she wrote. “I left with no regrets because of that and I’m proud of staying completely authentic and true to myself in this entire process.” After The Bachelor season 27 “Women Tell All” special, Lekha posted on her Instagram Story, “Shout out really to those of us who stuck to our values and decided maybe not to sell our soul to some franchise for clout or fame.”</p><p>Who is Greer from The Bachelor 2023?

But after poking around a little bit, asking around, what I can tell you is: I don’t know who the Bachelor’s going to be, but you can cross Nate off the list. I have heard it is not him,” Reality Steve said. “I usually can’t get any details to stuff like that. I have heard, I have no idea if it’s true or not, but I have heard he rejected it, he doesn’t want to do it.” A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> in August 2022 that Nate was the frontrunner to become the next Bachelor.</p><p>The reports also came after Nate was photographed holding hands with a woman at a grocery store in Chicago, Illinois, in August 2022, weeks after he cried over his breakup with Gabby on The Bachelorette season 19 “Men Tell All” special. “Spotted Nate and another girl in Chicago today,” an anonymous source sent to the Instagram account @bachelorettewindmill <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">along with a photo</a>. “They were both holding hands so could be dating?”</p><p>While Nate wasn’t the Bachelor 2023, Gabby told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in August 2022 that he was her number-one choice as the next lead. “Nate. 100 percent Nate, Nate, Nate!” she said. “He knows how to treat women. He’s so smart, he’s old, he has a great job, he spends his time reading—not reading social media, reading actual books. He has a daughter, so he knows what it’s like to have responsibility. He’s a real, true definition of a man.” Host Jesse Palmer also voted for Nate.&nbsp;“Nate is a standup guy. He’s an amazing person. He’s mature, he has an incredible emotional maturity, he’s vulnerable, he respects women, and he’s a great dad,” Jesse said. “I there’s there’s very few negative things I can say about Nate.” Jesse also had another choice for the next lead. “Are we still saying Pete Davidson? Is that still a choice?” Jesse said. “… I wanna ride that train. Wanna talk about a wild Bachelor season? That would probably be it. We might have to change some of our parameters.”</p><p>Gabby and Rachel also voiced their support for two Bachelors like how there were two Bachelorettes on season 19. “We loved each other for it, and loved having one another by one another’s side,” Gabby said of her relationship with Rachel. “I don’t know if men would feel the same, it depends on their relationship, but I think there’s a lot of good to come out of our season.” Rachel added, “I think ultimately if the Bachelors supported each other and loved each other to the extent that Gabby and I do, it could be incredible as well, but they would definitely have to be on the same level as us. Lots to live up to, of course!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jesse-Palmer-The-Bachelor-1.jpg><p>Who’s in The Bachelor 2023 cast?

Jesse told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in November 2021 that he and Emely planned to marry in Provence, France, before the current health crisis cancelled their wedding date. “We had originally planned a wedding in Provence, France, for summer 2020, which was postponed until summer of 2021 due to the pandemic, but we didn’t want to wait any longer,” he said at the time. “So, we had a small, private and intimate ceremony with close friends who lived in New York City.”</p><p>Jesse graduated from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played football for the Florida Gators, in 2001 with a bachelor’s of arts degree in political science and a bachelor’s of science degree in marketing. After graduation, Jesse was drafted by the National Football League to play for the New York Giants. He played with the team for four seasons from 2001 to 2005 as a quarterback. After the New York Giants, Jesse was drafted by the Canadian Football League to play for the Montreal Alouettes. He played with the team until 2005 when he was signed by the San Francisco 49ers. He then resigned with the Montreal Alouettes in 2006 before he retired from football in 2007 to pursue a broadcasting career. Since his broadcasting career started, Jesse has worked with networks like Fox, NFL Network, ESPN, ABC and SEC Network. He’s also guest starred on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and made guest appearances on shows like Recipe to Riches and Good Morning America, and hosted the Food Network’s Spring Baking Championship and Holiday Baking Championship.</p><p>Jesse was announced as The Bachelor season 26 host in September 2021. “For more than 20 years, The Bachelor has brought the world dozens of unforgettable love stories, including at one time, my own,” he said at the time. “Falling in love is one of life’s greatest gifts, and I am humbled by the opportunity to return to the show as host this season to offer the newest Bachelor advice gained from firsthand experience and I am grateful to play a small part in his journey.” The announcement came after Chris Harrison, the former host of Bachelor Nation, confirmed in June 2021 that he had retired as the franchise’s host after 19 years. “I’ve had a truly incredible run as host of The Bachelor franchise and now I’m excited to start a new chapter,” he wrote in an Instagram post at the time. “I’m so grateful to Bachelor Nation for all of the memories we’ve made together. While my two-decade journey is wrapping up, the friendships I’ve made will last a lifetime.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> reported at the time that Chris received a mid-range, eight-figure settlement as part of exit plan with ABC, the network that airs the Bachelor franchise, and Warner Bros. Television, the company that produces the Bachelor shows. The magazine also reported that Harrison’s settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. Chris’ decision to retire as Bachelor Nation’s host came after he was slammed for&nbsp;his response to season 25 Bachelor contestant <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael Kirkconnell’s racism</a> scandal in February 2021. <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael</a>, the <a href=# rel=noopener>winner of Matt James’ season</a>, faced backlash at the time when photos resurfaced of her at an Old South Antebellum-themed party at Georgia College in 2018. Before the pictures went viral, Rachael was already under controversy after her former high school classmate accused her on TikTok of bullying her and other students for dating Black men. Other TikTok users then exposed Rachael for liking social media photos of her friends in culturally insensitive costumes and with Confederate flags.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Chris came under controversy</a> after he was interviewed about the scandal by season 13 Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay on Extra. During the interview, Chris asked fans to give Rachael “grace” and explained that he didn’t find the Antebellum party photos offensive because they just looked like pictures a college student takes at a party. Harrison also questioned whether the photos would be considered racially insensitive in 2018 when they were taken. After the interview, many fans slammed Harrison and accused him of excusing Rachael’s behavior.</p><p>ABC confirmed in March 2021 that Chris wouldn’t host season 17 of The Bachelorette and would be replaced by Tayshia and Kaitlyn. “Chris Harrison will not be hosting the next season of The Bachelorette,” ABC said in a statement at the time. “We support Chris in the work that he is committed to doing. In his absence, former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe will support the new Bachelorette through next season. As we continue the dialogue around achieving greater equity and inclusion within The Bachelor franchise, we are dedicated to improving the BIPOC representation of our crew, including among the executive producer ranks. These are important steps in effecting fundamental change so that our franchise is a celebration of love that is reflective of our world.” He officially retired as the Bachelor Nation’s host in June 2021.</p><p>The Bachelor&nbsp;airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC and is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a>.
