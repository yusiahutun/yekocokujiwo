But for asthma-sufferers, the <a href=#><strong>summer season</strong></a> can present dangerous conditions through <a href=#><strong>asthma triggers</strong></a> that many are unaware of, such as thunderstorms.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-yellow-warm-color has-text-color"><strong>Summer asthma irritants</strong></h3><p>“Light rain can actually help improve ambient pollen for those whose asthma is triggered by summer allergens, but certain thunderstorms and weather fronts can concentrate mold and pollen spores and sweep them into the clouds,” says Laurie Manka, MD, a pulmonologist at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>National Jewish Health</strong></a>. “The humidity and electricity of the storm then rupture the spores, making them smaller particles that are more easily inhaled into the lungs and the sinuses.”</p><p>In addition to thunderstorms, mold from the hot, humid weather, grass and pollen allergens and smoke from things like wildfires, cookouts and fireworks can exacerbate <a href=#><strong>asthma symptoms</strong></a> in summer. As climate change lengthens the warm weather season and causes more severe weather, these issues are only expected to worsen over time.</p><p>“We can expect worse pollen seasons due to the increased temperature and longer growing seasons, as well as worsening air pollution with higher levels of ozone and more drought cycles leading to wildfires,” Dr. Manka states.&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s why it’s so important to track how these irritants affect your asthma, avoid exposure and have a solid plan with your doctor to keep asthma controlled on a daily basis, so when you do encounter these triggers, they’re less likely to cause a serious problem that can lead to hospitalization.”</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading has-yellow-warm-color has-text-color"><strong>Getting asthma symptoms under control</strong></h3><p>Bernice Roybal of Denver wasn’t diagnosed with asthma until adulthood, and as she learned more about how her lung disease behaved and reacted to environmental factors, she worked with Dr. Manka to get her symptoms under control.</p><p>“I didn’t even realize that I tended to have asthma episodes in the summer until Dr. Manka mapped them out and brought it to my attention,” Roybal says. “Now I’m able to take my daily medication and pretreat with an inhaler so I don’t ever get to the point where it’s out of control.”</p><p>Because smoke is one of her triggers, she also keeps a close eye on any nearby wildfires, as well as those in western states that may carry smoke long distances.</p><p>“Last summer here in Colorado, we didn’t have as many wildfires. But we certainly saw the effects of other wildfires on the west coast that had traveled hundreds of miles and therefore can affect a lot of people,” Dr. Manka states. “Many common summer grass and pollen allergens are also very light and can travel long distances in the wind, so it’s important to know about conditions that can affect your asthma outside of your immediate area as well.”</p><p>“There are times that I choose to stay inside if I know there is smoke in the air,” Roybal says. “But because I have good control of my asthma and I take these precautions when needed, I haven’t had to use my rescue inhaler in years, and my asthma really doesn’t prevent me from being able to do the things I love, like hiking and playing with my grandkids.”</p><p>Dr. Manka recommends keeping track of summer irritants by checking daily pollen counts and local weather forecasts. For those with persistent symptoms, she often sends patients home with a device that allows them to check their lung function daily so that together they can flag any changes and make necessary adjustments to their treatment plan.</p><p>Source: National Jewish Hospital, May 2023</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6W2r7PMmp5nm5%2BifLG%2BxKmYq51dm7yzeceim52dnmKxornAoJysZZ%2BberTBzKacq2WRqMGpucBmq6uhl5yys7%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./little-bao-goes-big-causeway-bay-disappointing-sharing-plates.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>May Chows Little Bao goes big in Causeway Bay: disappointing sharing plates, great dessert baos a</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cormoran-strike-everything-to-know-new-novel.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cormoran Strike: Everything to know about the new novel</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
