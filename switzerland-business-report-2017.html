Backed by a stable ownership structure and strong balance sheet, the group seeks value-adding opportunities including acquisitions and collaborations with partners with distinct networks and market knowledge to hasten its expansion plans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We offer a solid technology portfolio and we have good positions. We want to accelerate growth and that’s why we are focused on Asia,” Willome says. “I’ve lived in Asia for quite some time and I believe in the opportunities in the region, its potential and people.”</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">We offer a solid technology portfolio and we have good positions.

Showcasing Swiss brilliance, Conzzeta manufactures coatings for the global printing and packaging industry through Schmid Rhyner. With leading competencies for ultraviolet-curing, low migration and functional coatings such as the Touch & Feel surface, Schmid Rhyner enables effective packaging solutions with haptic effects for crucial differentiation at the point of purchase. Its sophisticated know-how helps safeguard and strengthen brands of top consumer products, food and cosmetics companies. It also enabled the development of the revolutionary digital varnishing technology diVar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Schmid Rhyner has a long tradition of manufacturing coating materials. Since its foundation in 1880, it has constantly pursued the highest quality standards by collaborating with customers in developing its products. It also provides client support through theoretical and practical training courses. Individual and on-site technical consulting sessions complement Schmid Rhyner’s programmes, from graphic design through to food safety in packaging. Acquired by Conzzeta in 1987, Schmid Rhyner manufactures in Switzerland and serves clients in more than 100 countries, including China and Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Conzzeta runs a second chemical specialities business under the FoamPartner brand. FoamPartner offers innovative, flexible foam solutions for a broad range of applications such as acoustic and thermal solutions within the automotive, filtration, purification, cleaning, surface treatment, packaging and sealing segments. Its portfolio also includes bedding products such as mattresses, pillows and cushions. As a supplier of tailor-made components and entire solutions for various industrial sectors, FoamPartner runs a polyurethane foam production and converting plant in Changzhou and sales offices in Shanghai and Singapore.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The future of Conzzeta is getting more global, but we still need to stay close to our customers,” Willome says. This is one of the reasons why FoamPartner implemented a new regional management structure to drive innovation in close cooperation with clients, to shorten development cycles and to accelerate growth particularly across Asia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Through Bystronic glass, Conzzeta has also been manufacturing equipment for the processing of flat glass in Shanghai since 2010. The products are mainly for the export markets, but the company aims to strengthen its capabilities to better meet the needs of the domestic market. Bystronic glass serves the architectural and automotive glass markets, and the company explores further opportunities for innovative thin glass applications.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We aim to complement our high-end solutions with quality mid-range products,” Willome says. “We see growth potential in China due to increased requirements in the pursuit of energy efficiency and noise reduction.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLDBza2psmWimr2wvtOsZpynpaPBs8WMq5ypp6KpwHDAzqmgnKtfqMSqwNmeqaWZnpl6o8HSoqWeq6Niv6a8zqurZmpgZoRwrdGtoJyklWR%2FcYOYbWlyZ5Oku7vGxK2Y</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./485320-john-paul-pitoc-5-quick-facts-american-actor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>John Paul Pitoc: 5 quick facts about the American actor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gary-anderson-christina-el-moussa-boyfriend-shady-past-revealed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Christina El Moussa's New Boyfriend's Costly Divorces Revealed!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
