Snow flying? It’s time to break out your warmest cold weather gear, ladies. And whether you need a puffer, a trench coat, or prefer wool, we’ve rounded up the best plus size women’s winter coats to suit every budget and style.</p><p>These stylish winter coats are from brands you know and love, like <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Canada Goose</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The North Face</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Columbia</a>, and also from a some brands you may not be as familiar with. They all have a few things in common though: Fashionable touches like faux fur, practical features like being water-proof and great in the snow, and of course all are good for cold weather!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the warmest winter coat?</h2><p>If you spend the winter months in an especially frigid climate, you need a coat that isn’t just fashionable and comfortable, but can stand up to subzero temperatures and gusty winds. Down, wool, and synthetic down all provide this kind of serious warmth, and you’ll also want to look for features like hoods with fur (or faux fur!) ruffs, fleece lining, and water-repellant outer shells. Storm plackets cover the front closure of a coat and keep the wind out, and long coats offer coverage for your rear end and even legs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Should you buy a winter coat a size bigger?</h2><p>This is a question people often wonder about, because when you’re pulling a coat on over layers of winter clothing and thick sweaters, you might need a little extra room. However, many coat manufacturers have thought of this, and built in a little extra room already. When you’re shopping for the best plus size women’s winter coats, you may already be looking for sizes at the upper range of what is available, so don’t worry too much about going up a size. Reading customer reviews can be helpful for hints as to sizing, and remember: Many online retailers offer free returns and exchanges, in case the size doesn’t feel quite right.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How many winter coats should a woman own?</h2><p>How big is your closet? There are so many different styles of plus size winter coats for women out there, it’s hard to limit yourself to just one. In general, it’s a good idea to have one coat for everyday and one for more formal occasions: a casual puffer like <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">this one from Barbour (buy at Nordstrom, $400)</a>, and a luxurious wool coat like <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">this one from Marina Rinaldi (buy at Bloomingdales, $1,155)</a>, for example. But it’s also nice to have <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">an extra warm coat</a> for those surprise blizzards, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">a trench coat</a> for rainy winter days, and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">a lightweight down jacket</a> that’s easy to ball up and carry with you in case the weather suddenly cools down.</p><p>Feeling inspired to add to your winter outerwear wardrobe?
