In lieu of an introduction, Blaine sat down before her, said, “I want to show you something” and proceeded to do a card trick. About a week later, on their first date, Blaine pulled out all the stops, going as far as to casually levitate in front of her. Yes, levitate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He has an amazing lure,” Apple told Black Book. “No matter how infatuated I’ve been with any guy, I always want them to go away. And I don’t really get it. The first time that he called, I said to my mom, ‘You know how I never want to spend time with anybody? Well, if there’s anyone who’s going to pull me away from that, it’s going to be this guy.’ From the first time I talked to him. He’s just full of everything.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, FYI, Blaine did not teach Apple his tricks. "Whenever I go any place with David and people ask, 'Oh, do you know all his tricks? No? He won’t tell you?'" she explained to Black Book. "No, I don’t ask. I don’t need to ask. He could tell you the answers and it would still be incredible. Why would I want to rob myself of that enjoyable naïveté?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While together, neither Apple nor Blaine had a home of their own, thus <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>“when the two of them are together, they end up wherever.”</a> Moving in together is probably logistically easier without a physical home to move into.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mediapunch/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> In an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>SPIN</a>, Apple issued an unorthodox but ultimately lovely quote about her relationship with Blaine. “David and I are both completely f—ked-up,” she said. “We’re the most f—ked-up people I know.” Ah, to be young, in love, and completely f—ked-up (together).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked: </strong>As you may have gathered, Apple and Blaine’s relationship was far from ordinary. And while spontaneous levitation and sleight of hand is fun and all, it takes more than magic tricks to win an argument. Apple recounted a turning point in her and Blaine’s time together after they’d had a particularly bad fight. He retired to the bedroom for a bit and emerged wearing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>“seven blazers, one on top of the other, and a white top hat with glow stickers on it”</a> — oh, and he was rapping … “It was so inexplicable,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Apple said</a>. “And I love that. I just love the way that his anger manifests itself. You’re having a fight with someone, why would you go and put on seven jackets and a top hat and start rapping?” But also, why wouldn’t you??</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup: </strong>Though the era of Blapple (sorry) was glorious, it was short-lived. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>By 1998, the pair had amicably split</a>. Yes, the word “amicable” is thrown around a lot when it comes to celebrity courtship, but this particular parting of ways truly was. The two remained friends, as Apple herself had predicted they would. While they were still together, she confirmed a rumor that Blaine had gotten her name tattooed on his shoulder. “He did it as a surprise. He had talked about it, but I kept telling him not to do it,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>SFGate.</a> “I would feel stupid if somebody had to get me removed. It's not like he'll ever have to get it removed, though, because we'll always stay best friends.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the split itself, neither party opened up about details, though in 2002 Blaine did tell <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Howard Stern</a> (whilst balancing on a pillar 100ft in the air, no less) that “[Fiona] broke up with me, in a nice way.” Apple, who was also on the somewhat <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>excruciating call</a>, objected to Blaine’s response (“Are you kidding me?”), though it was unclear whether she was reacting to the response itself or her ex’s willingness to share with the bullying Stern.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Anyway, Apple and Blaine stayed friends — the kind of friends who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>send each other’s partners baby gifts</a>, the kind of friends <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>who record sounds for their 2012 albums at each other’s homes</a>, the kind of friends who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>bring each other soup</a> when they’re sick (!!!).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Apple was still reportedly “disturbed” to learn of Blaine’s inclusion in Jeffrey Epstein’s “black book.”</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now: </strong>Blaine welcomed daughter Dessa with model Alizée Guinochet 2011. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>He and Guinochet were reportedly engaged</a> at one point, but they are no longer together.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After splitting with Blaine, Apple went on to date director Paul Thomas Anderson for several years, and then writer Jonathan Ames.The singer recently released her long-anticipated fifth studio album, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Fetch the Bolt Cutters.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGekl8FussiopZplkaW9rbGMnZivoZRir62tyKecZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./my-spy-chloe-coleman-on-first-blm-protest-working-with-dave-bautista.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>My Spy's Chloe Coleman on Her First BLM Protest, Working with Dave Bautista (Exclusive)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alx-james-wiki-age-gay-boyfriend-girlfriend-affairs-family-height-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alx James Wiki, Age, Gay, Boyfriend or Girlfriend, Affairs, Family, Height</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
