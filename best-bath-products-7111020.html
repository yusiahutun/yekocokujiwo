Lighting a candle, pouring an aromatic bubble bath (or sprinkling some muscle-relaxing salts), and spending an hour or two in the tub turns our tiny bathroom into a sanctuary, giving us time to unwind.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To create the most relaxing bath experience, we set out to find the best bath products that will turn your bathroom into a mini oasis. After taking over 25 baths and testing dozens of soothing products — including bath bombs, bubble baths, scrubs, salts, and soaks — we narrowed down the 14 best bath products that left us feeling completely rejuvenated.

Since discovering Dr Teal’s Foaming Bath with Pure Epsom Salt, we no longer have to choose between the two, because this all-in-one product combines our favorite elements to every bath: Muscle-relaxing epsom salts, long-lasting bubbles, and calming aromatics.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No matter how you’re feeling, there’s a foaming bath to fit your needs: The brand has 15 iterations, ranging from a formula meant to uplift your mood with a blend of citrus essential oils to a restorative soak made with eucalyptus and spearmint (our personal favorite), and even a lavender bath that is meant to lull you to sleep. Along with the stress-reducing benefits the product provides, each unique bath includes skin-softening ingredients like glycerin and magnesium (found in epsom salt), so our body is left feeling fresh and supple long after we drain the water.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With how often we use the foaming bath, we're very thankful it comes in such a large bottle — 34 ounces to be exact. We've found, though, that it takes a decent amount of product to procure the ideal amount of bubbles (we like our bath extra bubbly, so we end up using about ⅓ of the bottle per soak). Granted, you can customize the amount you use depending on your preferences, and at less than $10 per jumbo bottle, this is a worthy, affordable investment that you won’t feel guilty about purchasing again and again.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>34 oz. | <strong>Scents: </strong>15 | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Epsom salt, glycerin</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-native-body-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Native Body Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Native Coconut and Vanilla Body Wash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fUdg9NPCKT2oIyW-z5vc5eWkDAw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Native-Coconut-and-Vanilla-Body-Wash-9d92880444c54709b3cf22649f5dcb6d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From the minimalistic packaging to the simplistic ingredients, Native Body Wash is a no-frills yet delightful addition to your bathing routine. Because smell plays such a huge role when it comes to baths, we love that this cleanser is offered in over 15 scents, including more traditional calming fragrances like Cucumber & Mint, as well as sweeter aromas like Cherry & Vanilla Macaron, so you can find one that speaks to your mood. (Some reviews say certain scents cause a rash. We didn’t experience this when testing the product, but if you have more sensitive skin you can <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>opt for the fragrance-free version</a>).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the fragrances stray from the ordinary, the formula provides a classic cleanse that boosts skin hydration without the inclusion of sulfates, phthalates, or dyes. Plus, it can be used for more than just basic body cleansing — when poured under running water it makes for a luscious, frothy bubble bath.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>18 oz. | <strong>Scents: </strong>20 | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Coconut oil, cleansing salt, citric acid</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-luxury-natureofthings-restorative-floral-bath></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Luxury</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Natureofthings Restorative Floral Bath</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Natureofthings Restorative Floral Bath" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oUZdIr_DbR8a-OYFpGb15oMNnog=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Natureofthings-Restorative-Floral-Bath-7cd876ba0ea742a29caae1399b14d895.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Natureofthings</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ever wish you could recreate the blissful feeling of lounging in a field of wildflowers without stepping foot outside? Well, you can with the Restorative Floral Bath from Natureofthings. The milky, mineral-charged elixir turned our tub into a heady bouquet of plumeria, jasmine, and vetiver, and Dr. Jonathan Leary, founder of social wellness club <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Remedy Place</a>, loves how it awakens and rebalances the senses for an overall calming effect.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The bath immersion doesn’t just hold aromatherapy benefits, though — it contains a variety of holistic ingredients to improve overall health. Within the ingredient list you’ll find capsicum: A compound derived from chili peppers that holds anti-inflammatory benefits to ease joint and muscle pain by subtly increasing blood flow and warming the skin; shea butter and green tea, which work to quickly soften and detox skin; and pulverized malachite and rose quartz powders — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>crystals known to have energy-clearing properties</a> to help you feel at peace.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">20 minutes is all we need to emerge feeling rejuvenated, though we understand if you want to stay submerged for hours on end. In fact, you may want to extend your soak to get the most out of the floral bath — the bottle is pretty small, so you’ll likely only be able to use it for two or three baths before you need to repurchase.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6 oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Scents: </strong>1 | <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Rose quartz powder, malachite extract, hops extract, cedarwood oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-baby-wash-ncessaire-the-body-wash></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Baby Wash</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nécessaire The Body Wash</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/1KfHTE_cl3AD1l3rT_4K2foodIc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ncessaire-the-body-wash-69aebed035604371b89b727c87934415.jpg"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we wish sitting in a foaming bath on its own could rinse away the grime of the day, it's imperative to use a body wash to achieve the deep clean you’re after. Luckily, a simple lather with Nécessaire The Body Wash makes the mundane task feel surprisingly luxurious. Infused with a slew of skin-nourishing ingredients (including glycerin, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>niacinamide</a>, and vitamins C and E), the formula quickly transforms into a rich foam that effectively cleanses away sweat, dirt, and grime from our body in a matter of seconds. And once the body wash is rinsed away, our skin feels fresh and soft rather than stripped.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because scent plays such a big role when it comes to relaxation, we appreciate that you can choose between three fragrances (eucalyptus, bergamot, or sandalwood), as well as a sensitive skin-friendly fragrance-free option, to customize your bath experience. Though, keep in mind that the scents are pretty light, so you won’t leave the bath smelling like a spa.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>8.4 oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Scents: </strong>4<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Glycerin, niacinamide, vitamins C and E</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-body-scrub-selfmade-true-grit-resilience-scrub></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Body Scrub</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>selfmade Resilience Scrub</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="selfmade True Grit Resilience Scrub" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/XS5kk5Lw8kYdr26sHhii7Mnq4-E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/selfmade-True-Grit-Resilience-Scrub-3590f116cd344534b4c9558821d6f350.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>selfmade</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some people may argue that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>body scrub</a> does nothing more than slough away dead skin — but truthfully, the right scrub can do so much more. Take this one from selfmade, for instance: The brand set out on a mission to create emotionally intelligent personal care products that promote emotional growth and well-being. From the thoughtful name to the gentle yet powerful formula, the True Grit Resilience Scrub encourages your mind to take a breather, plus, it offers plenty of physical benefits, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a combination of physical and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>chemical exfoliators</a> (gritty bamboo powder along with kiwi and pineapple extracts) it buffs away dead skin while simultaneously unclogging pores and preventing ingrown hairs. Gentle enough to use on your face, scalp, and body, the invigorating scrub leaves our skin feeling baby soft, and ultimately makes us feel a bit more relaxed (in part thanks to the calming palo santo scent).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re accustomed to thick, grainy scrubs you won’t find that here — this one has more of a jelly texture with small, granular flecks which makes it thinner than other options, but just as (if not more) effective.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>7 oz. | <strong>Scents: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Bamboo powder, natural fruit AHAs, vitamin C, tea tree oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bath-oil-osea-malibu-vagus-nerve-bath-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bath Oil</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Osea Bath Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Osea Malibu Vagus Nerve Bath Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IE-_4M9_FFNYRTVwtqDc9BZzn-g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Osea-Malibu-Vagus-Nerve-Bath-Oil-929e46200be341b4a634af5beba39ef2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Osea</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Have you ever heard of the vagus nerve? As the longest nerve in the body, it runs from the brain all the way to your gut and plays a key role in regulating emotions, stress levels, sleep, and even digestion. Essentially, the nerve can act as a reset button for the mind and body — as long as you stimulate and engage with it through laughter, meditation, exercise, or with the Vagus Nerve Bath Oil from Osea Malibu.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Swirling a bit of this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>luxurious oil</a> into our bath immediately envelops us with feelings of serenity. Crafted with a blend of over a dozen essential oils (including grape seed, apricot kernel, meadowfoam, and avocado, to name a few), the oil recharges our body on multiple fronts: Softening skin, relaxing pent up tension, and melting away anxiety with its soothing aroma. We like to start our bath with a few deep breaths to let the oil’s full effects sink in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it’s time to head back to reality, we feel a renewed sense of harmony —&nbsp;but we have to slowly and carefully exit the bath, as the oil can leave a slippery residue after the water is drained. To avoid any falls, we recommend wiping the tub down so it's good to go for your next shower.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5 oz.<strong> </strong>| <strong>Scents: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Grape seed oil, rice bran oil, apricot kernel oil, avocado oil</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bath-bomb-lush-cosmetics-lakes-bath-bomb></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bath Bomb</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lush Cosmetics Bath Bomb</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Lush Cosmetics Lakes Bath Bomb" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PvVyBs6-RUleSBhVPQp-uQJpHnk=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lush-Cosmetics-Lakes-Bath-Bomb-c5f60a1fb93440d6a63b851d44daa1d4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lush Cosmetics</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>This isn’t a huge turn-off, but it turns the bath water bright green, which could be unsettling for some.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Transforming your bathtub into a dreamy Claude Monet painting doesn’t require hundreds of watercolors or the mind of a master painter — truly, all you need is this bath bomb from Lush.

Then, we felt the nourishing mix of coconut and olive oils, as well as shea butter and kaolin clay melt into skin, replenishing moisture levels while simultaneously cleansing away the day’s debris. The tiny lavender buds scattered throughout the soap aren’t just for looks — the flowers act as a delicate exfoliant, buffing away dead skin, and leaving skin smooth, soft, and rejuvenated.

The vibrations subtly ease muscle tension and we enjoy seeing a more robust lather form as we work this across our body. While compact (it fits perfectly in our palm), it’s still easy to maneuver around larger areas of the body, but we do wish it was a bit bigger to cover more surface area at once.

A few of the items on our list contain both, but <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bathing Culture Big Dipper Mineral Bath</a> is especially great at melting muscle tension thanks to its mix of four mineral-rich salts.&nbsp;Along with calming sore muscles, Epsom salt can also reduce anxiety and quiet the mind due to its magnesium-rich makeup.

That feeling isn’t just in your head. In fact, soaking in the bath has been proven to host a plethora of well-being and physical benefits. “Bathing can fight depression, burn calories, improve heart health, help you breathe easier, soothe joints, reduce pain and inflammation, and can also help balance your hormones,” explains Marcy Miller, founder of Pure Placid.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The well-being and joint-soothing benefits are talked about more than anything, but baths can also address certain skin strifes. “Baths help our skin rehydrate its natural barrier and replenish the lost moisture,” says Dr. Henry. “They can also soften the skin texture, plump up its appearance, and create an overall hydrated glow.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, the products you include in your soak can enhance the overall benefits, but the water temperature can also play a big role in your well-being, explains Dr. Leary. “A hot bath will allow your body temperature to heat up, which will help improve blood flow and circulation throughout the body,” he says. “While a cold bath decreases inflammation, especially deep in your core or joints, which may be harder to get to.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What products should I use in the bath?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">From bath salts, bombs, and soaks to bubble baths, there are an array of products you can add into your bath water to enhance your soaking experience. When it comes down to what you should use, though, you should keep your overall needs and preferences in mind.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for muscle relief after a particularly intense training session, Miller and Dr. Leary agree that epsom salts or magnesium-based soaks will help remedy any tightness or soreness. “Epsom salts have high levels of magnesium that reduce pain and tightness in muscles and help reduce stress, detoxify, and reduce inflammation,” Miller explains. Beyond alleviating sore muscles, though, Dr. Henry adds that magnesium helps to hydrate and soothe skin as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bath salts of any kind can also aid in reducing skin flare-ups such as eczema. “Salt is antimicrobial, which helps soothe skin conditions,” says Miller. For extra dry skin, Dr. Henry recommends looking for coconut based bath products, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Palermo Body Lavender + Sage Soap</a> because they can “reduce dryness and are great for sensitive skin types.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For some people, the most relaxing bath involves bubbles or a kaleidoscope of colors.

From lighting a candle, to picking the perfect bath oils and salts, the scent should be one that promotes relaxation,” says Miller. “Lavender is well-known as being a relaxing scent, but so too are rose, bergamot, cedar, and vanilla.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though those with sensitive skin are often told to avoid any sort of fragrance, Dr. Henry explains that many scented bath products are formulated with sensitive skin in mind. She says that soaks and salts made with soothing ingredients, like shea butter and coconut milk (both of which have a natural scent), are typically the best for those with sensitive skin who still want to experience some sort of aromatherapy benefits while soaking. When in doubt, you can always light a candle instead (you can’t go wrong with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Glasshouse Fragrances Forever Florence</a>), and stick with fragrance-free products.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you do notice any irritation (including redness, bumps, or itchiness), Dr. Henry says you can quickly remedy the situation by draining the bath and taking a lukewarm shower to dilute the effects on your skin. If any issues persist, consult with your dermatologist.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mary Honkus</a> is a Beauty Commerce Editor at InStyle with over five years of experience covering makeup, skincare, and hair care.
