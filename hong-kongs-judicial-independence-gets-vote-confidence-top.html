cases, sparking concerns as to whether this would allow interference in the work of the judiciary.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Citing

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In June, a former top British judge, Baroness Brenda Hale, also said she would quit the Court of Final Appeal when her first term expired in July.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Lord Jonathan Sumption, one of the British judges on the bench, asserted in March that calls

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In May, former chief justice Geoffrey Ma Tao-li defended the role of foreign judges in the city, arguing they should continue to sit

short of extending his full support for Hong Kong’s top court.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Lord Reed’s statement was cautiously guarded in

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Read together with the last paragraph which emphasised on a continuous assessment of the Hong Kong position as it developed, it is an affirmation of his and other UK judges’ role as ‘canaries in a coal mine’, namely, if judicial independence and autonomy are further compromised, there could come a day when these canaries would abandon the coal mine so as to warn those concerned that there was danger.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He added: “There remain lawyers and judges in Hong Kong who are

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, which former Bar Association chairman Ronny Tong Ka-wah found surprising given the minister had previously questioned whether the country’s jurists should continue to serve on the city’s courts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pro-establishment lawmakers also applauded the decision.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Our judiciary has remained intact, and applied the law independently. Even though the security law is quite new and judges are not too familiar with it yet, they have tried their best,” legislator and lawyer Paul Tse Wai-chun said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This decision is a very good reference for other judges, and Hong Kong authorities should go all out in promoting this, not just issuing some statement to repeat jargon.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tse expressed hope that the development indicated Sino-British ties would improve, even as Washington’s international reputation was tarnished by its disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Legislator Holden Chow Ho-ding, also a lawyer and a deputy leader of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, said Reed had spoken the truth in acknowledging the city’s long-standing judicial independence and robust rule of law.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I hope other foreign politicians will also reverse course and abandon their way of smearing our ‘one country, two systems’,” he said, referring to the governing principle under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/08/28/1eb1c062-0727-11ec-a83e-ec0670db1017_1320x770_000336.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Barrister Eunice Yung Hoi-yan, vice-chairwoman of the New People’s Party, hailed the “professional judgment” of the top British jurists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“National security laws are not unique to Hong Kong – the US and other countries have similar laws – and now the international community has cast a vote of confidence in Hong Kong’s application of the law, and its rule of law,” she said. “There are good reasons for foreign judges to stay in the Hong Kong court.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Ex-justice minister warns of risks to Hong Kong’s rule of law from outside</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The judiciary issued a statement in response to the British judges’ move.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[We are] an independent judiciary that upholds the rule of law.
