Next thing I knew, the people I work with were here. And we've married into each other's families," Carlile says in a Q&A that follows <a href=#>an essay she penned for&nbsp;Parents magazine's February 2020 issue</a>.</p><p>Carlile, Shepherd and their kids live in a log cabin the singer bought when she was 21 years old, and her bandmate Phil Hanseroth and his wife Tiffany, who is Carlile's sister, live next door with their two children.</p><p>Nearby — close enough to get there via ATV, according to the artist — are Tim Hanseroth, Phil's twin and another of Carlile's bandmates, his wife and their two kids, as well as Carlile's cello player, Josh Neumann, and his wife Sarah, who is Catherine's sister. The couple welcomed a baby girl in November.</p><p>"You get so tired of your own cooking — so, say it's Josh and Sarah's night to cook. We can go to each other's houses. We have a garden that we all can work in. We built a deck and put in an above-ground pool. We've done all kinds of projects together — anything to keep ourselves busy," Carlile says. "Everyone helps the kids with learning. It's a community-based effort."</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>Brandi Carlile Parents magazine cover</span></p>Victoria Kovios for 'Parents'<p>loading...</p></figure><p>This "it takes a village" parenting style has proven beneficial for Carlile and Shepherd, who, as&nbsp;two gay women, do not have the benefits of generations of institutional parenting wisdom and knowledge that straight parents, especially those in heterosexual relationships, do.</p><p>Notes Carlile, "It might not feel radical to talk about LGBTQ+ parenting right now, but over the arc of history,&nbsp;gay&nbsp;domesticity is a radically new concept."</p><p>"There's some serious pioneering involved here," she writes. "Now I want to be a part of building some of that history for other LGBTQ+ parents."</p><p>"For my wife and me, every part of our emergence into the world of parenting was intentional and always felt a little like walking out onto thin ice, blindfolded,"&nbsp;the singer-songwriter adds. "To my immense relief and delight, Catherine and I found a total abundance of support from our friends and family around us who had kids. It felt like joining some kind of a club. It actually made me feel cooler."</p><p>Carlile and Shepherd conceived their first child, Evangeline, who was born in 2014, via in vitro fertilization (IVF). Daughter Elijah, born in 2018, was conceived via artificial insemination. Shepherd carried both children.</p><p><strong>Country Music's Greatest Love Stories:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6qRo7GqecKaqaWhnJp6sa3RnqWtq12irqit2aKlnmWVqMCixYycpqaon6q7pXnHqKSeZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erica-michelle-levy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erica Michelle Levy Bio, Wiki, Age, Height and Weight</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jann-mardenborough-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Wheres Jann Mardenborough Now?
