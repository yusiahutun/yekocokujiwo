The Mesopotamian social structure was highly stratified. It was divided into royalty (king and nobility), priests and priestesses, the upper class, the lower class and slaves.</p><p class=align-left>Each group included various members of the society and had their function that kept the community functioning.

Other popular upper-class occupations were architects, accountants, shipwrights, scribes and astrologers. Scribes were highly respected and worked for kings, in the temple, court and schools – every teacher was a scribe.</p><h3 id=539616-4-lower-class class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. Lower class</h3><p class=align-left>The lower class had occupations that kept the region operating: farmers, soldiers, sailors, musicians, prostitutes, artists, carpenters, jewellery makers, fishermen, baker and more.</p><p class=align-left>Of those listed, jewellery makers, perfume makers, prostitutes, and goldsmiths could be considered upper class under the right circumstances, such as finding favour in a king or wealthy person or because of exceptional skills.

Slaves</h3><p class=align-left>The slaves were the lowest in the Mesopotamia social structure pyramid.

The furniture was made from wicker wood, and the most common were chests, stools, tables, sofas, baskets and reed mats. Wealthy Mesopotamians decorated their tables using metal.</p><p class=align-left>House vessels were made from stone, copper, clay and bronze. People lighted their homes by putting a wick made of wool or reed in sesame seed oil and lighting it. Statues were hidden inside the house to ward off evil spirits.</p><p class=align-left>In addition, bathrooms had bathtubs, stools, mirrors, jars and large water pitchers.

As in many civilisations, the nobility and the upper class wore more expensive clothes.</p><p class=align-left>The style usually changed with time, but essential functions and forms remained the same. After animal domestication, wool was the most common primary material for clothing and leather for footwear (at least for the rich). The wealthy could afford brightly-dyed fashion, while the others wore basic white or black.</p><p class=align-left>Woven fabric (linen) then became popular and was used to make various clothing, including skirts, dresses and more. The Mesopotamians also wore jewellery, and the popular ones were ankle bracelets, gold earrings, silver hair rings, medallion pendants, amulets, cylinder seals and more.</p><h2 id=539616-faqs-about-mesopotamia class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>FAQs about Mesopotamia</h2><li>What was the largest social class for Mesopotamians?
