Along with the new chips, Apple has launched new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros. If you're thinking about purchasing one of these laptops, you may have doubts about which configuration best suits your needs. Both the M2 Pro and M2 Max are very powerful, so it's not an easy decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We'll compare the specifications, performance, and price of these chips to help you pick the best option for your needs.</p><h2 id=m2-pro-vs-m2-max-specs>M2 Pro vs. M2 Max: Specs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/apple-macbook-on-a-table-1.jpg><p>As mentioned above, both the M2 Pro and M2 Max chips are very powerful. However, there are a number of key differences to note. The M2 Pro features up to 12 CPU cores and 19 GPU cores. The M2 Max, on the other hand, has 12 CPU cores and up to 38 GPU cores. Both chips offer more cores than their respective M1 versions, though the M2 Max sees a greater increase with six more GPU cores, compared to three more than the previous generation in the M2 Pro.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If don't know <a href=#>what a nanometer is</a>, it's a unit of measure for length, and the Apple M2 Pro is built on a five-nanometer process. This new chip has a total of 40 billion transistors, about 20% more than we saw in the M1 Pro. Bandwidth comes in at 200GB/s, with up to 32GB of low-latency unified memory.</p><p>Regarding the M2 Max, the CPU now has 12 cores compared to 10 in the previous generation, with a GPU of up to 38 cores and a 16-core Neural Engine. The M2 Max has 67 billion transistors. With this chip, the bandwidth comes in at 400GB/s, double that of the M2 Pro and four times that of an M2. It also supports up to 96GB of unified memory. The CPU is exactly the same as the M2 Pro, but the GPU is significantly more powerful and features a larger L2 cache.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col></th><th scope=col><p>M2 Pro</p></th><th scope=col><p>M2 Max</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>CPU cores</p></td><td><p>Up to 12</p></td><td><p>Up to 12</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>GPU cores</p></td><td><p>Up to 19</p></td><td><p>Up to 38</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>RAM</p></td><td><p>Up to 32GB</p></td><td><p>Up to 96GB</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bandwidth</p></td><td><p>200GB/s</p></td><td><p>400GB/s</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=m2-pro-vs-m2-max-performance>M2 Pro vs. M2 Max: Performance</h2><p>The main advantage of the M2 Max over the M2 Pro is in the GPU. If we take a look at the Geekbench 5 test results, we can see that the difference in CPU when comparing the M2 Pro and the M2 Max with 12 cores is minimal; almost non-existent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/geekbench-5-apple-silicon-cpu-comparison.jpg><p>However, when we test the graphics performance of the two chips, the difference is astounding: the M2 Max is 35% better. Apple has restricted the M2 Pro to a maximum of 19 GPU cores, whereas the M2 Max can have up to 38 GPU cores. Hence, for those seeking powerful graphics capabilities, the M2 Max offers the maximum potential.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=m2-pro-vs-m2-max-price><img alt="Chart showing a geekbench 5 apple silicon gpu comparison" height=949 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/geekbench-5-apple-silicon-gpu-comparison.jpg width=1412 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>M2 Pro vs. M2 Max: Price</h2><p>Both the M2 Pro and M2 Max are high-end Apple silicon chips, so their prices are also high. However, the difference between them is substantial. Right now, you can buy a 14-inch MacBook Pro with the entry-level M2 Pro chip for $1,999 in the US. Likewise, the 12-core CPU version of this chip would cost you an additional $300.</p><p>The M2 Max version with 30 or 38 GPU cores would cost you $2,899 and $3,099, respectively. In other words, from the entry-level M2 Pro to the entry-level M2 Max there is a difference of almost $1,000.</p><p>Is it worth it? It all depends on what you want to use your new MacBook Pro for.</p><h2 id=m2-pro-vs-m2-max-which-one-do-you-need>M2 Pro vs. M2 Max: Which One Do You Need?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/geekbench-5-apple-silicon-gpu-comparison.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You have to consider what you need a new MacBook Pro for. If you're familiar with <a href=#>what CPUs do</a>, and you're going to be doing mostly CPU-demanding tasks, like video editing or advanced coding, the M2 Pro seems like a better choice. As we have already seen, there is hardly any difference in this area between the two chips, and with the money you would save you can always buy more RAM or storage to future-proof your investment.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are going to perform GPU-demanding tasks such as <a href=#>3D graphic rendering or modeling</a>, the M2 Max with its 30 or 38 GPU cores is probably better for you.</p><p>If you're still torn between these two chips, or you're not sure which is the best option for you, our recommendation is to go to an Apple Store and buy a MacBook Pro with the M2 Pro chip. Try it for a few days, and if you find that the power isn't enough, take advantage of Apple's return policy and exchange it for one with the M2 Max chip.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=two-great-options-to-power-your-macbook-pro>Two Great Options to Power Your MacBook Pro</h2><p>Apple silicon is revolutionizing the world of processors. The fact that Apple is no longer dependent on Intel gives it much more freedom to develop its Macs, and this sometimes makes it difficult to know which chip is best for each specific case. The best thing to do is to try until you find the right one.</p><p>If you already have a general idea of what you need, buy one with a good return policy and try it out. Depending on how you get on, you can keep it or change it for a model that better suits your needs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGika2Wgp7xuwtJmpGtlnZbFcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./worlds-largest-tequila-bar-launches-28589234.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>World's largest tequila bar launches bingo bottomless brunch with 'non-stop fun'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kurt-bardella.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kurt Bardella</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
