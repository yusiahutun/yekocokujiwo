Former royal correspondent at the Telegraph, Gordon Rayner has previously <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">claimed</a> the monarch thinks lunch is a “luxury”, and that there is not enough time in his schedule.</p><p>The 74-year-old’s former press secretary, Julian Payne <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> The Mirror what she learned from his schedule, as she said: “The King doesn’t eat lunch; so, an early lesson I learned when out on the road with him was to have a big breakfast or bring a few snack bars with you to keep you going.</p><p>But don’t fret, the heir to the throne does keep his fuel up, despite not eating at engagement. During a trip to Cornwall, he spoke to nutritionist Monique Hyland.</p><p>His diet that day included “two eggs, wholemeal toast with butter, apple juice and a cup of tea with milk and sugar for breakfast. For lunch, he had a ‘rubbish sandwich’ and for dinner, white fish with mushroom, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> by Cornwall Live.</p><p>He also had “a banana and chocolate brownie as snacks and two to three cups of coffee and a glass of red wine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1198625868-1024x720.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-harry-reveals-his-favorite-foods>Prince Harry reveals his favorite foods</h2><p>Now we’ve established the King and William’s eating habits, we may as well look into <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> too. The Duke revealed a lot in his memoir Spare, including family feuds. However, he did include more light-hearted topics as he shared his favorite food.</p><p>The 39-year-old’s favourite food is in fact, roast chicken. Both Harry and Meghan Markle are big fans of the dish and prepared some together on their first dates. He even ordered some for his wife while she was giving birth to their first child, Archie.</p><p>Although, it’s nothing out of the ordinary. The exact place he orders from is in fact, Nandos.
