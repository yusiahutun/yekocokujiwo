That was the last document loaded into the lengthy case file.</p><p>The Jones County Sheriff’s Department is handling the investigation and the findings will be turned over to the Jones County District Attorney’s Office and presented to a grand jury.</p><p>Davis lives next door to the West Franklin Street home that his sister and Marshall shared for 12 years and were raising their children in. But she filed for divorce in March after a couple of disturbing incidents that were described in detail in filings in Jones County Chancery Court.</p><p>On Feb. 23, Marshall reportedly loaded a gun and threatened to kill Davis next door, and then on March 2, he got a gun and threatened suicide while the children were home, according to the divorce complaint his wife filed at the time. Law enforcement responded to the home in that incident and Marshall was transported to Pine Grove Mental Health.</p><p>Marshall had worked as an occupational therapist and was living in a mobile home at the 1200 block of Highway 28, where he was being allowed visitation with his children under the supervision of his parents, according to an order that was filed in July. He had repeatedly threatened to come get the children and take them to his parents’ home in Georgia to get them away from their mother. He claimed in court filings that she used illicit drugs and made illicit videos.</p><p>She accused him of “cruel and inhumane treatment” in addition to physical abuse. McCoy had been called to the house for disturbances three times in a period of about four months leading up to her filing for divorce, according to the court documents.</p><p>Marshall had served as an alderman and volunteer firefighter and owned a disaster-relief service, according to a Dec. 16 Leader-Call story about his running for mayor of Soso in a recent special election. He received five of the 137 total votes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcL%2FOrKZmm5GjsaqwwK2cZquYpMFusMSam2iZoqm2pLjEmGdvcGhqg3SCjJprn5ldZn6msYxya2psXWaAdYWUbm9qb2lnsW%2B006aj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-wear-coach-citysole-sneaker.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Wear The Wear-Anywhere Fashion Sneaker</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./oprah-winfrey-turn-your-wounds-into-wisdom.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Oprah Winfrey: 'Turn your wounds into wisdom.'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
