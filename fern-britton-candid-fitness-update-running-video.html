Then I picked it up again and carried on until the end. It’s just finished, I’m on the warm-down walk."&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Fern Britton films inside beautiful kitchen at family home</figure><p id=eQcRjv1K6j0 data-wc=47>She continued: "And it was hard! It is difficult. I won’t wear my go-faster trousers on the next run in a couple of days but I thought I’d share that with you because some of this is very hard. It isn’t really, I just started too fast."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/35374516da7f-fern-britton.jpg><p id=eKYZndOpWbX data-wc=48>The star was inundated with support and liked a comment from a fan that read: "Don't take any notice of some of the criticism.

I applaud you."&nbsp;</p><p id=emCc8FtSAV data-wc=10><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Fern Britton shares she's awaiting major surgery – details</a></strong></p><p id=erBOmsWjdSF data-wc=61>Another person added: "When I did couch to 5k I adopted the tortoise and the hare method… there’s no rush, you get there in the end, you’re doing a fabulous job," while a third person wrote: "But Fern you picked it up again! You are doing amazingly well!! Just love seeing your progress - you should be so chuffed with yourself."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e1fc4b9ba021-fern-britton-smile.jpg><p id=eV_ostfhY78u data-wc=76>Another fan requested that Fern returns to television instead, adding: "Fern never mind all this running it's back on tv, you need to be daytime tv was worth watching when you were presenting but then if I'm honest. I wouldn't give up the lovely life you have in a beautiful place so only joking about the running, you're an inspiration to the ordinary woman who's not afraid to be seen with no make-up and messy hair."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3dc224e35bb4-smiling-fern-britton.jpg><p id=ekl_HdX8rFi8 data-wc=58>Fern recently opened up to Good Housekeeping about whether she would ever return to her presenting career, saying: "I don't think I’d be able to turn the clock back; it wouldn't work that way. My time at This Morning was marvellous and I adored the 10 years I was there, but I feel you should never look back."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7fb7f722eed6-shutterstockeditorial9764705ai.jpg><p id=etP7gQnv4s6T data-wc=70>After leaving This Morning in 2009, it was claimed she felt "undervalued by ITV" and that she was "living in Phil's shadow". Phillip later revealed that they were no longer on speaking terms, telling Heat magazine: "We were involved in the show and mates at the time, but we don't really. I see Phil [Fern's then-husband, chef Phil Vickery] when he's in This Morning… But we're not in touch now."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
