The superstar was performing to a sold-out crowd in Glendale, Arizona, when she exited the stage during the song Alien Superstar after the power reportedly cut out. Fans at the stadium were then left hanging for about ten minutes before Queen Bey made a return in a new outfit and performed the song again. Beyonce even made a reference to the moment later in the show when she joked that it was the fans being loud that caused the sound issue.</p><p id=eBQDjc90mg data-wc=14><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The Daily Lowdown: Taylor Swift shares glimpse of new version of hit song</a></strong></p><p id=emG1g1oWOzj data-wc=16><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The Daily Lowdown: Scooter Braun breaks his silence after Ariana Grande and more cut ties</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/99b62f3e06c7-367390753184285678420080352306329094598216958n.jpg><p id=e3vSN1GJ7nz data-wc=86>Olivia Rodrigo has tied with Taylor Swift for the second-most No.1 hits in the history of Billboards Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart among female artists.

There's no word on whether the album from Drizzy will be released later in the day or over the weekend, but the internet has exploded with memes from fans who are sitting patiently awaiting the new music.
