He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible.

It was carried out at the London Clinic private hospital, where Catherine, the Princess of Wales, had surgery the week prior. Queen Camilla paid her husband a visit and told reporters as she left that, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>He’s doing well</a>, thank you,” per the BBC.</p><p>Buckingham Palace provided details on his surgery in the hopes that it would raise awareness.

Everyone is staying optimistic, but he is really very unwell. More than they are letting on.” Another source, who knows a senior official involved in the planning of royal funerals, said: “They are looking at every aspect of Menai Bridge. The queen’s funeral went like clockwork and set a high bar. It’s not an emotional thing, it’s a job, one taken very seriously, and understandably no one plans to get caught out.”</p><p>However, a military source the outlet spoke to said that “planning for the worst is what the military do,”&nbsp;adding, “The whole thing goes from flash to bang in under two weeks which means every aspect of it needs to be meticulously planned in advance.
