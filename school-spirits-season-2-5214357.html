Naturally, viewers have been hungry for season 2 news. The Paramount+ series recently became available on Netflix, so the love for School Spirits has only grown.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>What do we know about School Spirits season 2? What happened at the end of season 1? From the show’s renewal status to filming news, <strong>Hollywood Life</strong> has all the news you need to know about School Spirits season 2.</p><h2>Will There Be a ‘School Spirits’ Season 2?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>School Spirits was renewed for season 2 back in June 2023. The first season premiered in March of that year and consisted of 8 episodes. Paramount+ released a video after the renewal. “You asked… and we heard you. School Spirits season 2 is official,” the video announced.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“School Spirits has captivated audiences with its gripping storyline, engaging characters and the enigmatic world of high school life, and we are thrilled to bring a second season to this loyal fan base across Paramount+,” said <strong>Shauna Phelan</strong> and <strong>Zack Olin</strong>, Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Heads at Nickelodeon and Awesomeness live-action series and films. “Maddie’s quest to unravel the truth behind her mysterious disappearance has resonated with viewers, and we can’t wait to continue this thrilling journey with them.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>Domenic DiMeglio</strong>, chief marketing officer and head of data at Paramount Streaming, also said: “School Spirits developed such a passionate and engaged fan base over the course of its first season, marking one of our most popular new young adult series to date. The creative minds behind the series – showrunner Oliver Goldstick and creators Nate Trinrud & Megan Trinrud – and the extremely talented cast brought audiences a fresh take on high school – both in the present and in the after-life – and we can’t wait to see what happens next at Split River High.”</p><h2>When Is ‘School Spirits’ Season 2 Coming Out?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>School Spirits season 2 does not have a premiere date yet. When the season 2 renewal was announced, Paramount+ revealed that season 2 would go into production in 2024 and premiere at a later date. It’s likely the second season won’t premiere until late 2024 or early 2025.</p><h2>‘School Spirits’ Season 2 Cast</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>The main School Spirits season 2 cast is expected to return. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Peyton List</strong></a> will be back as Maddie Nears, alongside <strong>Kristian Flores</strong> as Simon, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Milo Manheim</strong></a> as Wally Clark, <strong>Spencer MacPherson</strong> as Xavier Baxter, <strong>Kiara Pichardo</strong> as Nicole Herrera, <strong>Sarah Yarkin</strong> as Rhonda,<strong> Nick Pugliese</strong> as Charley, and <strong>Rainbow Wedell</strong> as Claire Zomer.

They couldn’t write during the strike. Yeah, they’re just getting to it. But the conversation is open. And I will keep you posted when I learn more stuff.”</p><h2>How Did ‘School Spirits’ Season 1 End?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>The first season of School Spirits gave fans answers but also added many more questions about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>what really happened to Maddie</a>. Wally and Charley discover that Janet, a former member of the afterlife group therapy, died alongside Mr. Martin in the school fire that he started.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/school-spirits-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-13>Meanwhile, Xavier is seriously injured after a mysterious person hit him with their car. This mystery person is caught on video.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>In a shocking twist, the mystery person is Maddie! Turns out, Janet is possessing Maddie’s physical body. Maddie’s spirit is trapped at Split River High School, where Janet ran into Maddie. However, she’s technically still alive. In the last moments of the finale, Janet (in Maddie’s body) is seen getting a bus out of town.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>There are plenty of questions that will have to be answered in season 2. What is the relationship between Janet and Mr. Martin? Why can <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Simon REALLY see Maddie</a>? What are Mr. Martin’s intentions? Will Maddie’s body and spirit be reunited? Is Spencer OK? Season 2 will certainly explore these questions and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Kcn6innGLAsbXRoqusZaOarrS7zWZpZm1iZoF0gZZo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sky-katz.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sky Katz Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fall-2014-makeup-trend-eye-makeup.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pops of Color on the Eyes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
