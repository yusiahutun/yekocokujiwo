The Hong Kong-Macau Express coach bus service on Friday said it would resume service on Saturday, with four buses running from several casinos in Macau to Prince Edward in Hong Kong from 8am to 2pm, and heading in the opposite direction from 10.50am to 4.50pm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The high-speed ferry service between Hong Kong and Macau is also preparing for a resumption. A spokesman for Shun Tak- China Travel Ship Management, which runs the TurboJet ferry service, said the company was “happy to see the government improving quarantine measures”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/23/53c2cfc5-3335-435f-b759-23610d70682e_bd0f1980.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The ferry service between Hong Kong’s international airport and the Taipa Ferry Terminal is also set to return on December 30, according to an announcement by authorities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Earlier this month, the shuttle bus service on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge was increased to 10 trips from Hong Kong to Macau, and nine the other way.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong Tourism sector lawmaker Perry Yiu Pak-leung said it was good that Macau was now welcoming travellers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Before Covid, Macau was a popular travel destination for Hong Kong residents, and many stayed in the city for one night during the weekends,” he said. “About 1 million people travelled from Macau to Hong Kong each year, and about 7 million visitors travelled from Hong Kong to Macau per year.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yiu said Macau’s reopening would help make both cities more attractive to tourists.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The charm of Hong Kong as a single destination is limited. But as twins, travellers can come to Hong Kong for its theme parks and cultural hub, followed by Macau’s food, casinos and World Heritage sites. The two former colonies can create great synergy,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Additional reporting by Karin Lyu, Kahon Chan and Chris Lau</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoq6uZnqi9sL7TaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtnbWxlbHy1vsCnqqmnoql6tLHRr6CcnaNir6bA1p6cp2WYpLuoecqopaBlkaOxbrnAnJiuZaKawba%2BzWaqqKWVYr62sdKtoKimXZiutLXNqGShrZKoerOxzqmcp6GenHqiucid</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-do-we-need-to-share-truth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why do we need to share our truth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-brady-iii-and-jackson-hinkle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Brady (III) and Jackson Hinkle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
