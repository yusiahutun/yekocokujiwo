It was <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Kate's first appearance after the infamous Oprah interview</a>, and she stepped out in the pink Max & Co ‘Runaway Classic’ coat for a visit to School21 following its re-opening after the easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions in east London.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFjDFlC-9Lb data-wc=52>We all gasped in delight as we watched Kate greet royal well wishers in her pink mid-length coat which she teamed with a pink top and a pair of black trousers. I remember the high street instantly followed suit and soon after this appearance we started to see bubblegum pink coats everywhere.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/816ee8d873fd-kate-middleton-pink-coat.jpg><p id=eX7uxPvNCO data-wc=51>We weren't complaining, and we're still not, because now <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">M&S has dropped a £49.50 pink coat</a></span> (or <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">$86.99 if you're reading this in the US</a></span>) that is so similar, with its big pockets, and colour pop pink, I had to run to my local M&S to take a look for myself.&nbsp;</p><p id=eAyIC0CRspQ data-wc=92>I found it really easily - with a colour that bright, it's really hard to miss. I have to talk about the colour first. It's stated as a medium pink but this isn't a Barbie pink shade or even bubblegum pink like Kate's, it's almost neon and it's so fantastic in real life, you will swoon when you see it. In fact, it's one of those colours that you know will bring compliments from strangers on the street. I adore the colour but I realise it might be too bright for some.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/425baa1d7c96-leanne-bayley-pink-cat-try-on.jpg><p id=e4LOCKlONt data-wc=76>The single breasted coat is a relaxed fit, I did size up when I tried it on as I wanted it to be a bit slouchy but my usual size also fitted me. I don't think there's all that much difference in sizes. Some of the comments online say the arms are too long, but I didn't notice that as an issue for me. I'm only 5 ft 4, and I liked the length on me. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=ennqzTRi_hs data-wc=73>I need to flag something important though - this coat does not have lining. This coat isn't to be purchased if you're wanting a new warm coat that will make you feel toasty and warm. This is a fashion coat, and could well be one that you wear indoors as well. It'll be great for a <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>wedding guest dress</a> as you can just throw it on and you're not restricted with the lining.&nbsp;</p><p id=ehcvZSutn9n data-wc=48>I don't actually mind that this coat is lightweight because I get too hot in big bulky coats and as we move into spring this will be worn on repeat, and while it's still really cold I'll be sure to throw on a big chunky scarf as well.&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/33e34f64fcba-ms-pink-coat.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£49.50 AT MARKS & SPENCER</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>$86.99 AT MARKS & SPENCER US</p></a><p id=er2HjzSKaHu data-wc=40>One review on the Marks & Spencer site sums it up pretty well, saying: "Lovely casual coat…comes up quite large and not suitable for very cold weather, but fab for a dry slightly nip in the air kind of weather."</p><p id=evu3ZDQp5lF data-wc=17>That's exactly what it is - a nip in the air kind of coat. I love that.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKVo61MNKlp data-wc=66>My favourite thing about this coat (well, apart from the colour!) has to be the two side pockets - they're so in-line with how Kate's coat looked, and what made me rush to the shop to try it on. I also tend to carry around lots of things such as my iPhone and my AirPods with me and these will keep my essentials close at hand.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/df8fed2e14ad-leanne-bayley-wearing-pink-coat-close-up.jpg><p id=ezLRE2t4FKa data-wc=56>The price tag is super affordable for a coat from M&S but it's pretty obvious when you know it's unlined, and it's not made with any lavish wool material, it's made with recycled polyester. I'm not opposed to it, but it's important to tell you this as you're not getting a warm winter coat for £49.50.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZYO5lhxF0u data-wc=56>I tried this on with my <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>straight-leg jeans</a> and a tee but I cannot wait to wear it with my <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>shirt dresses</a> or with my <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>wide-leg trousers</a> for work. M&S also stocked it in an oatmeal shade - which is dreamy and very Cameron-Diaz-in-The-Holiday but alas, it's sold out at the time of going to press.&nbsp;</p><p id=eBEs3yGI2h9 data-wc=100>I predict the pink one will sell out, too. Although I was only trying this on for work research purposes, I went straight to checkout and bought it. The colour sparked a lot of joy for me, and I can see it working really well in my wardrobe. I'm blonde as well and it made my hair colour pop and worked with my skin tone. I actually think this will suit everyone, but you've got to be prepared for the 'ooh, I love your coat' compliments because this isn't just your average pink coat, it's an M&S neon pink coat.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I've found the 10 best coats on sale to save you having to search" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4f3b6d966201-best-coats-on-sale.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I've found the 10 best coats on sale to save you having to search" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I've found the 10 best coats on sale to save you having to search</a></h5></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="8 best pink coats to brighten up your winter wardrobe" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/807dceb75d9b-best-pink-coats.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="8 best pink coats to brighten up your winter wardrobe" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>8 best pink coats to brighten up your winter wardrobe</a></h5></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Kate Middleton's Pop-Up Shop: 14 of Princess Kate's go-to brands" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/6b9113d6a979-kate-middleton-mcqueen-gettyimages-1676487783.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Kate Middleton's Pop-Up Shop: 14 of Princess Kate's go-to brands" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Kate Middleton's Pop-Up Shop: 14 of Princess Kate's go-to brands</a></h5></li></ul><p id=ehRkuNrAHuH></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqLWwvM%2BipaBnZWZ%2FdICWaKSaqpuoeqK6w2aqqZ2emLKzecKomK1lnJ64pnnKmqueZZ2esaW4xK2mp2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1970s-tv-sitcoms.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>1970s TV Sitcoms: Your Guide to 106 Comedies of the Decade</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maria-nagai-tiktoker-bio-height-age-boyfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maria Nagai (tiktoker) Bio, Height, Age, Boyfriend, Family, And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
