According to Keough, the pair attended a party for <a href=#>Elvis</a> one day after Austin Butler <a href=#>won a Golden Globe</a> for his performance in the Baz Luhrmann biopic. “We had dinner,” Keough recalled. “That was the last time I saw her. I remember thinking about how beautiful she looked, and that was my strongest memory of the dinner.” Presley was hospitalized and died at age 54 the next day, on January 12. When asked what she would want people to remember about her mother, Keough emphasized Presley’s ability to be “unapologetically herself” despite “treachery” she endured. “People were just coming for her since she was born — wanting something from her and not being totally authentic,” Keough said. “She had to develop very thick skin. She was a very powerful presence and extremely loving and extremely loyal and sort of a lioness — a fierce woman, and a really wonderful mother. I think that would be my summary because I’m her daughter. She was the best mom.” Keough’s brother, Benjamin Keough, died in 2020. With the loss of both family members, Keough reflected that parts of herself have died, and that she has felt like her heart has “exploded.” “But I also feel … I’m trying to think of how to phrase this … I have strengthened the qualities that have come about through adversity,” she said.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cll38jhuy003h3b6x9hm4nrxe@published data-word-count=133>Presley’s death was followed by a <a href=#>monthslong family dispute</a> over who would inherit Elvis’s estate. “Everyone was in a bit of a panic to understand how we move forward, and it just took a minute to understand the details of the situation, because it’s complicated,” Keough said. “We are a family, but there’s also a huge business side of our family. So I think that there was clarity that needed to be had.” The <a href=#>Daisy Jones & the Six</a> actress recently became the sole trustee after reaching a settlement — reportedly to the tune of $1 million and $400,000 covered in legal fees — with her grandmother, Priscilla Presley. Luckily, these legal matters apparently haven’t caused their relationship to sour. “Things with Grandma will be happy,” Keough said. “They’ve never not been happy.”</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Vanity Fair</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clfmyjnhj00000iihiq8vvjhd@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Elvis Estate’s Trust Issues Are Over</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clctncj3800000ibp0uvw4rvl@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Singer Lisa Marie Presley Dead at 54 After Hospitalization</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clctycvps00150id8a021fu5h@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Riley Keough, Austin Butler, and More Remember Lisa Marie Presley</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Riley Keough Remembers Lisa Marie Presley As ‘the Best Mom’</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgbXyztcuesGajlaTCqLSMqKVmpJmorm65wKugnmWgp7K0uMSyZJ6kpp7AbrHSrZitnV6dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ingrid-hoffmann-chef.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ingrid Hoffmann dating?
