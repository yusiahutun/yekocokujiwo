As a result of which, the show creators have brought in its newest spinoff, Bling Empire: New York, which is pretty much the same as the original except it follows some of the real-life Crazy Rich Asians based on New York. Vika Abbyaeva is one of the cast members of Bling Empire: New York.</p><p>Keep reading this article to know more about Vika.</p><h3><strong>Bling Empire New York: Are Vika Abbyaeva And Richard Chang Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Vika Abbyaeva met Richard Chang, a chief growth officer at Hudson Medical and a Bling Empire: New York star, around 2020. After knowing for a few months, the two moved together just before the COVID lockdown. Vika and Richard got to spend a whole lot of time together enabling them to establish their bond.</p><p>“In the last couple of years, I’ve probably been easily on a thousand dates. I had to try a lot of different flavors in order to know what I actually like. But then, I met Vika,” Richard said in the Netflix show at one point.</p><p>However, as we saw in the show, the couple did face major hiccups in their relationship. When Vika mentioned that she was planning to join a girls-only trip to the Bahamas, Richard asked her not to go because he did not want Vika to be alone with them.</p><p>The former Director of Merchandise planning at Calvin Klein, Richard went as far as to call Vika “stupid” for even considering that move despite knowing all about Richard’s squabbles with a couple of the girls.</p><p>Richard immediately knew he did something wrong and regretted what he said. In fact, Vika did not talk to him the entire weekend she was in the Bahamas.</p><p>After knowing that Richard did not want Vika to go on a girl’s trip, Lynn, another star of the Netflix show, claimed, “Why is he telling you what you can or can not do?” Instead of going against Richard, Vika sided with her beau and explained that he was just being protective of her, which irritated Lynn and she called Vika “brainwashed.”</p><p>While Richard did apologize to Vika as soon as she returned from the trip, she did warn him that she won’t stand for it again if Richard again makes the same mistake of talking down to her.</p><p>Little did Richard, who was ready to propose to Vika upon getting unsubtle hints from his mother and his brother, know that there was yet another bitter moment waiting to happen in their relationship after he had first hurt his girlfriend by calling her “stupid” for agreeing to go on a girls’ trip.</p><p>Mid-proposal, when Richard was sharing his plans for their future together, Vika interrupted to say that she was not ready to tie the knot at such a young age of 26. Although the Netflix star confessed that she was in love with Richard and believed they would be best together for the rest of their lives, Vika simply did not think it was a “good time” for her to marry.</p><p>The couple’s huge 11 years of age gap certainly was not the reason for Vika halting Richard’s proposal as we now know that the duo is still together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Vika-Abbyaeva1-226x300.png><p>Judging from their social handles, the couple is living happily together in their home in New York while also occasionally going on a vacation together.
