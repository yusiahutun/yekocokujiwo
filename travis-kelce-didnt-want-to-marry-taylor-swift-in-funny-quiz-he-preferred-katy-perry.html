However, his response may shock you.</strong></p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> went public in September after <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> was spotted cheering on the NFL star at a Kansas City Chiefs game. <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> had a crush on the singer before they got together, even trying to get a friendship bracelet to her backstage on her Eras Tour. However, according to this unearthed video of Travis Kelce playing Kiss, Marry, or Kill, he may have had a bigger crush on Katy Perry years ago….</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-2004235823-3-682x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-plays-kiss-marry-kill-but-he-doesn-t-pick-taylor-swift>Travis Kelce plays ‘Kiss, Marry, Kill’ – but he doesn’t pick Taylor Swift</h2><p>In 2016, the Kansas City Chiefs Tight End was asked to participate in a game of Kiss, Marry, Kill in an interview, and the ‘culprits’ Travis Kelce was met with, were Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, and <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>.</p><p>“Damn, that’s messed up!” the star responded. “I don’t want to kill any of them.”</p><p>As the interviewer laughed and told him it was just a game, he responded, “Ariana, I’d kill, unfortunately. Love you, but you’re gone.”</p><p>With his ‘so 2016’ quiff haircut, Trav then went on to say he’d kiss now girlfriend Taylor, and marry Katy Perry! Well, he definitely manifested kissing Taylor, as we’ve seen in the many pics and videos!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-answer-screams-bad-blood>His answer screams Bad Blood</h2><p>This is even more awkward considering the Bad Blood – pardon the pun – between Taylor and Katy. Perry <a href=# rel=nofollow>confirmed</a> the frenemies on and off friendship with the Lover hitmaker with James Corden in 2017. It appears they made up but the years-long feud is as spicy as her song lyrics. I wonder what Tay Tay thought if she ever saw the clip of Travis Kelce choosing Katy in Kiss, Marry or Kill.</p><p>Although they haven’t even been together for a year, Swiftie’s are convinced Travis is ‘the one’ for her, as it seems so different from her past relationships.</p><p>Taylor’s last public <a href=#>relationship with Joe Alwyn</a> was notoriously private, despite it lasting for six years. We’ve had more Trav content in six months than Joe in six years!</p><p>Celebrity psychic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Adam Norton</a> also told Celebrity Tidbit that he predicts 2024 is the year <a href=#>Kelce will pop the question</a>, so watch this space!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This older video is being resurfaced where Travis Kelce plays Kill, Marry and Kiss using Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and Katy Perry.</p><p>Surprisingly, he does not choose marriage with Taylor Swift 👀</p><p><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JZ1iVSf7ql</a></p>— NFL Notifications (@NFLNotify) <a href=#>October 3, 2023</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-have-already-shown-their-commitment-to-each-other-with-air-miles>The couple have already shown their commitment to each other – with air miles</h2><p>Although their relationship is still in the early stages, the commitment between the two has shown their in it for the long run – and long haul.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Bad Blood singer flew from Tokyo after her concerts to make sure she was in the stands to see Kelce and the Chiefs win the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a>.</p><p>The 34-year-old then returned the favor a couple of weeks later as he flew to Sydney to support Taylor on tour for a couple of days, as well as go on a <a href=#>cute date to the zoo</a>.</p><p>Couple goals!</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eGcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGabopyeqXq4rc2tZK2nXaKus77YZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWZo3qnwc2nsGappZ7HbrTEZqernZaav7Oxw2aimqypYr2mvtGyZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./travis-kelce-teases-moving-into-the-movie-business-with-dream-role.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Travis Kelce teases moving into the movie business with 'dream role'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./time-magazine-fake-covers-golf-clubs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Time Magazine asks Trump to remove fake magazine covers from golf clubs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
