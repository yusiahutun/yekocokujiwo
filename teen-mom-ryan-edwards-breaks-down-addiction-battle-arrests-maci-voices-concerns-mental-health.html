Jen said Maci recently texted him, "Tell Ryan. He's worth it." Jen and Larry told Ryan that he has to "believe" he's worth it.</p><p>Larry then hit Ryan where it hurts, telling him to think of his three children.

"Think about where she might wind up if you're not there to protect her because I won't be here forever.

While at the restaurant, Edwards discussed his decision to go to a treatment center for 30 to 45 days, admitting that he doesn't "like myself when I get f--ked up."</p><p>Ryan and Maci also agreed that the former would tell Bentley about what's been going on with him, before Bookout then voiced concerns about Edwards' mental health after he said his "chest is so tight."</p><p>"Are you anxious?" she asked Ryan, who replied, "F--k yeah. I'm anxious because I either got f--king court every day or you don't know when the f--king police are going to knock on your door or some bulls--t."</p><p>Maci brought up how she heard that Ryan was put on "suicide watch" after his latest arrest, noting that she was "really worried" and that he needs to "talk to somebody about that."</p><p>"It would be devastating to a lot of people if you weren't here," she said. "I'd rather you be a pain in my ass, but be here than not."</p><p>"So next time, just call me," she added as Edwards -- who was visibly emotional -- wiped away tears.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7bac13b9-8fff-4b4a-940e-9f44c7665615 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6bfdd19a-a559-4d0c-b38f-24c07bc2e5a5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f4/5by4/2023/08/01/f4f9e6811e4646c597b09b5c58bec481_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">MTV/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ryan Edwards Confirms Relapse, Denies Holding Mackenzie at Knifepoint and Cries Over Son Bentley</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In a confessional, Maci became emotional as well, breaking down in tears as she discussed Ryan's struggles with addiction.</p><p>"I think obviously with him being an addict, that's big, that's a big mountain to climb," she told the MTV cameras. "You're always afraid that call's gonna come that day or that night. ...
