The iconic actress shares a few homes with her longtime love, <a href=#><strong>Kurt Russell</strong></a>, but they typically spend the majority of their time at their home in Los Angeles. The couple resides in a luxurious mansion in California, where they love hanging out with their blended family, including their beloved <a href=#>children</a> and <a href=#>grandkids</a>.</p><p>According to the Death Becomes Her actress’ Instagram, Goldie and Kurt live in a massive home filled with several bedrooms, bathrooms, multiple living areas, a kitchen, an indoor gym and more. In December 2020, the <a href=#>Academy Award</a> winner showed off her gorgeous living room while <a href=#>decorating her Christmas tree</a>. “Happy holidays. Wishing all of you a peaceful, healthy and joyful Christmas,” she penned.</p><p>Goldie previously uploaded a pic in January 2020 of her adorable pups, which offered another look inside her lavish abode. “I just had to post this. My kitchen is alive with love,” she wrote in the caption.</p><p>As for the outside of their lovely living space, the <a href=#>Overboard</a> alum’s property boasts a beautiful landscape with a garden and other colorful shrubbery. The backyard also has unique decor, including a Buddha model on display in her garden, as well as a giant cow statue.</p><p>Prior to living in their current pad, Goldie and Kurt — who <a href=#>began dating in 1983</a> — previously resided in an estate in the Palisades Riviera neighborhood of L.A. The Hollywood pair sold their former home for $6.9 million in 2017, <a href=#>Architectural Digest</a> reported. Their previous mansion was just as immaculate as it featured five bedrooms, a media room, vaulted ceilings, a guest suite and much more.</p><p>Aside from their California property, the First Wives Club actress and the Escape From New York actor also own homes in New York and Colorado. Considering their older children, <a href=#><strong>Oliver Hudson</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a>, are parents of their own, having houses around the country makes it easier to spend time as a family.</p><p>One of the duo’s favorite “family [traditions]” is to <a href=#>visit their vacation home in Aspen around Christmas</a>. “Goldie and Kurt love getting away to Aspen for the holidays,” an insider once shared with Closer. “The older Goldie and Kurt get, the more blessed they feel. Skiing or relaxing, they consider that perfect happiness.”</p><p>Being together under one roof also allows the <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> winner and Kurt to spend time with their <a href=#>grandchildren</a>, including <a href=#>Kate’s kids, Ryder, Bingham and Rani</a>, and Oliver’s brood, Wilder, Bodhi and Rio. The duo’s son, <a href=#><strong>Wyatt Russell</strong></a>, welcomed his first child, Buddy, in March 2021.</p><p>“Being surrounded by their children and grandchildren is what life is all about,” the source explained. “They really are one of Hollywood’s most tight-knit families. The holidays may bring them together in Aspen, but they’re just as close the rest of the year too.”</p><p><strong>To see a glimpse inside Goldie and Kurt’s amazing life, scroll through the photos below to tour their L.A. home!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn56qlWKxsLHSZp6opJSesm60wLClZqSZq7JuvMeoq6irXaSzbriMmmShp52aeri106FkpK2iqXqzwdKsnKWkXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./raspberry-buttermilk-cake.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>raspberry buttermilk cake</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cathy-moriarty.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cathy Moriarty - Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Facts, Nationality</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
