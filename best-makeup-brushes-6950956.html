You can have the most skin-like foundations, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lit-from-within highlighters</a>, and buttery eyeshadows, but they’ll do you little good without <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>the proper tools</a>.

So much so that I own four, and keep one in my work bag at all times for on-the-go touch ups. The bristles are densely packed but luxuriously soft, making for a seamless application that feels great on skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And while its intended use is applying foundation and concealer, the brush is also great for buffing in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cream and liquid contour</a>, blush, and bronzer. The result is a flawless but natural-looking base. In a real pinch, you can even use the concealer brush for shadow application, making it a true one-and-done tool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I’m not the only fan, though: Countless makeup artists and thousands of shoppers have all sung its praises. That being said, at nearly $50 a pop, the brush is definitely an investment — one that might not be worth it for those less passionate about makeup and beauty in general. But for those who prioritize multifunctionality and quality, this is a no brainer. I also have to admit that while the dual-sided design is genius, it’s not the easiest to store.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Type: </strong>Synthetic | <strong>Shape: </strong>Double-ended dome | <strong>Intended Use: </strong>Foundation, concealer | <strong>Vegan: </strong>Yes</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Joy Kim</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-liquid-foundation-brush-hourglass-ambient-soft-glow-foundation-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Liquid Foundation Brush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hourglass Ambient Soft Glow Foundation Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hourglass Ambient Soft Glow Foundation Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AYbR6UlgH_ezr_-V7_1F018f2dU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hourglass-Ambient-Soft-Glow-Foundation-Brush-5d843931b1f348d5a93bb8f27d7cb21f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s nothing worse than finding streaks of excess foundation all over your brushes, blushes, and bronzers.

And while in a perfect world we’d wipe any excess foundation off before moving on, this isn’t always the reality.

Luckily, what it lacks in size it makes up for in seamless application, flawless precision, and a skin-like finish without getting your hands dirty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The densely packed bristles and unique shape lends itself to getting hard-to-reach spots like the nasolabial folds.

Beyond the price (which is so good), Martin counts this brush’s versatility as a major selling point — it plays nicely with creams, liquids, and powders alike.

Crafted with cherry wood sourced from Japan and handmade, cruelty-free polyester bristles, this liquid blender brush from Westman Atelier is as luxe as they come. It smoothes product quickly and evenly, leaving a seamless finish on the skin in just a few swipes. Similar in shape to a kabuki brush, with slightly denser, shorter bristles, it makes second skin-like coverage so easy to achieve, it’s nearly fool-proof.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though densely packed and stiff, the bristles are still soft to the touch and feel plush — not rough — on the skin.

Plus, the soft edges of the brush are ideal for hard-to-reach spots like the sides of the nose and under eyes.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Type: </strong>Polyester | <strong>Shape: </strong>Compact round | <strong>Intended Use: </strong>Blending liquid makeup | <strong>Vegan: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-powder-foundation-brush-elf-flawless-face-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Powder Foundation Brush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>e.l.f.

But I quickly came to realize that wasn’t the case: The most seamless application doesn’t depend on the foundation itself, but rather the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>foundation brush</a> used. And after years of putting up with subpar brushes that left me with a patchy complexion, I struck gold with this affordable tool.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This foundation brush picks up the ideal amount of product with a quick swirl in the compact, and blends it out like magic. The beauty is in the duality — the fluffy brush has two sides: a flat edge that allows for seamless, all over application, and a skinny edge that provides more targeted application. I use the former to buff out an even layer of foundation all over my face, and the latter to build up extra coverage where I need it most.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To make things even better, it works exceptionally well with other powder products too (especially blush and bronzer), so it is multipurpose if you want it to be. The one thing that could improve, though, is the bristle quality: Over time the synthetic fibers fall out, but that typically happens after a few years of use.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Type: </strong>Synthetic | <strong>Shape: </strong>Fluffy with flat and skinny ides | <strong>Intended Use: </strong>Powder foundations, bronzers and blush | <strong>Vegan: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-concealer-brush-dior-backstage-concealer-brush-no-13></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Concealer Brush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dior Backstage Concealer Brush No. 13</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dior Backstage Concealer Brush No. 13" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6Q5d60blUb8muPo0BwKI0auoXsc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dior-backstage-fe98710c303b4bed9a4b69836d499f4e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bloomingdale's</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Flat with a tapered “cat’s tongue” shape and rounded tip, the brush is ideal for pinpointing imperfections and gives professional results with a smooth, blended layer of concealer. Best of all, the flat edge makes the brush a great multitasker — stipple on concealer under the eyes or pat in some powder in those hard-to-reach spots.

Yes, this is technically a blush brush, but I actually don’t think it’d be very good for that. Instead, its large brush head and fluffy shape works far better when applying <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bronzer</a>.

According to Phillips, this brush is the “perfect size and softness for applying blush to the apples of the cheeks.” And I have to agree.

Just be sure to glide it lightly around the eye area, otherwise it can uncomfortably tug.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Type: </strong>Synthetic | <strong>Shape: </strong>Pencil | <strong>Intended Use: </strong>Eye liner, blending on the lash line | <strong>Vegan: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-eyeliner-brush-mac-208-synthetic-angled-brow-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Eyeliner Brush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MAC 208 Synthetic Angled Brow Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="MAC 208 Synthetic Angled Brow Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5AsVlnp_HFMBJjnB_vaO39pcXLg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MA-208S-Synthetic-Angled-Brow-Brush-cd1f8ae252c543218090044fb0ad7328.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Upper lash liner is a dangerous game: Make one wrong move and suddenly your liner went from subtle to full-on graphic. This brush’s flat, angled head makes it easy to stamp on color and ensure a thin, consistent line from inner corner to outer wing. Plus, the sharp tip and edges make for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>flawless, precise wings</a>. Thanks to the thin, flat shape, you can customize your liner width to your liking, and the stiff bristles stay taught on the eye. The brush is ideal for both gel shadow liners, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It definitely takes some practice to get used to this brush shape compared to your average flat-edged liner brush, particularly because of the longer bristles.

While the angled liner brush is thin enough to make hair-like strokes with cream and gel formulas, I prefer to dip it in a powder and use it to fill in a light wash of color on my brow. It helps fill in any spots or gaps, and the spoolie ensures optimal distribution of color. Plus, it sweeps my brows into place without scratching the skin beneath it.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-100 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Type: </strong>Synthetic | <strong>Shape: </strong>Angled liner | <strong>Intended Use: </strong>Cream, powder, and gel eyebrow formulas | <strong>Vegan: </strong>Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-set-spectrum-kjh-11-piece-edit-brush-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Set</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spectrum KJH 11 Piece Edit Brush Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spectrum KJH 11 Piece Edit Brush Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/M3JVDi-_7gMKrQxjnTRrs9DFxVM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spectrum-kjh-11-piece-edit-brush-set-2a79895f4025417480d928129208d80c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spectrum Collections</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-103 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve ever so much as dabbled in makeup, you’re probably familiar with celebrity and editorial makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Katie Jane Hughes</a>, who regularly paints the faces of Hollywood’s elite — including Ashley Graham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Following the massive success of the 25-piece brush set she created with Spectrum Collections in 2021, the duo took fan feedback to heart and created this 11-piece edit for those who want a condensed collection of artist-inspired tools.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The set is, in a word, impeccable. It’s beautifully designed and is as functional as it is luxurious. The bristles are soft and fluffy and remain that way even after countless washes (I’ve owned the 25-piece set for two years and still use the brushes every time I apply makeup). The brushes are generally smaller than traditional makeup brushes and feature longer bristles that give an airy, almost watercolor-like quality to the application process, and an airbrush-like effect to makeup (rather than something more full coverage-looking).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The collaboration truly excels with its eye brushes, which account for eight out of the 11 included. The selection goes far beyond traditional eyeshadow brushes, though, including petite accent brushes and variously sized fine pencil-type brushes. Phillips, who works with Kendall Jenner, Hailey Bieber, and Jennifer Lopez, says they’re mainstays in her own collection. Our only complaint is that the other 14 brushes from the original set are no longer available.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bristle Type: </strong>Synthetic | <strong>Shape: </strong>N/A | <strong>Intended Use: </strong>Full face | <strong>Vegan: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Bristle Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Makeup brush bristles tend to fall into two categories: natural (hair) and synthetic. Synthetic bristles seem to be more common these days, and Martin much prefers them, but natural bristles do offer a softness sometimes harder to recreate with synthetic fibers. Even within the general category of synthetic bristles, brands use different processes to make them, resulting in a range of textures and softness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“I look for a thicker, denser brush when I need to pack on color,” says Phillips, “and a lighter, wispier brush when trying to diffuse and blend.” Razzano echoes her sentiments, explaining that fluffy, loose bristles apply products in soft layers, while shorter bristles apply a heavier application of color. As bristle density increases, it’s easier to buff in product. For those who have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sensitive skin</a> or are allergic to animal products, avoid natural-hair bristles.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Makeup Needs</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your own makeup skills, daily needs, goals, and budget should factor into which brushes you purchase.

Larger brushes tend to offer less control and precision, but smaller brushes lengthen the overall makeup application process.
