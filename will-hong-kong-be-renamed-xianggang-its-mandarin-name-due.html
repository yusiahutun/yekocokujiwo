The last dynasty, let us not forget, hailed from this northeastern region, and until these invaders became fully Sinicised, the Manchu were regarded as foreigners and, by direct implication, barbarian inferiors to the Chinese over whom they ruled.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Until the Qing dynasty’s end, in 1912, Manchuria remained sparsely populated; permanent settlement by Han Chinese from elsewhere in the country was officially restricted.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This situation changed in succeeding decades; as in every other frontier region of China, from Tibet to Xinjiang, a deliberate policy of Han Chinese settlement to displace and outnumber the original inhabitants reduced the native Manchu to a minority group within their ancestral homeland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Japanese invasion of Manchuria, in 1931, was part of a progressive southwards grab for natural resources – the first stage of what culminated in the Pacific war.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/05/a4e45d8a-31d9-4d36-8b2a-90a00efdf564_9001b47a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1934, the Japanese declared Manchuria independent and installed Aisin-Gioro Puyi, the last Manchu emperor of China, as Emperor of Manchukuo. Ignored diplomatically by most powers – the Vatican was an exception – the country notionally existed until 1945. It had its own stamps – which the Universal Postal Union recognised as valid for external mail – currency, flag and head of state.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So, like it or not, Manchuria did indeed exist as a country in its own right, both in premodern and more recent times. Therefore, a movement to recreate that separate identity, in some form, might – perhaps – gain traction if a spark was ever allowed to catch fire.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other, even more incendiary contemporary flashpoints exist. Formosa – another “deprecated exonym” – was for centuries the generally used term for Taiwan. First used by early Portuguese mariners, Ilha Formosa, which literally translates as Beautiful Island, suits the place well.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During the Cold War era, Formosa became a politically laden term generally deployed to signify political support for the Nationalist government, ousted from the rest of China by the Communist assumption of power, in 1949; it remains popular with contemporary Taiwan independence advocates.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Will Hong Kong, in due course, be replaced by Xianggang, with the old name relegated to “deprecated exonym” status? Such a dramatic toponymical change would delineate the ultimate convergence of “two systems” with “one country”. While both terms are simple transliterations of Fragrant Harbour, any controversy would originate from local resistance to more widespread introduction of Mandarin terms into everyday life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkHJobHBkZMSquMtmn6iml2K4sLrGZpmeZaKau6K5xJ1ksaGRo7Sorc2gZKKso2K6orrDmqmipl2jrq6xjJ2sng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-martin-net-worth-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Martin Net Worth | Wife</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mossley-afc-20-football-club-facts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mossley AFC: 20 Football Club Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
