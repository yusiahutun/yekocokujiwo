Henson isn't one to gatekeep beauty secrets. Inspired by her own DIY scalp remedies, the award-winning actress launched her haircare brand, TPH by Taraji, in 2020 to provide efficacious, affordable products that emphasize the importance of scalp care, especially for those who wear protective styles like braids, wigs, and weaves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now Henson is aiming to turn your entire shower routine into a moment of self-care with Body by TPH, a collection of nourishing body care products with luxurious scents and textures that can be used solo or layered like you would in your facial skincare routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"People are a little traumatized from the pandemic and they're not socializing as much or going to spas as much because there's still the fear of COVID," Henson tells InStyle. "During shutdown, I was teaching people how to do their hair at home and now it's like, let's turn that Sunday chore into a ritual. While you have your hair mask on, you can indulge in a nice deep, relaxing bath with a relaxing candle. Or you can get your energy the next morning from the mandarine and ginger in the body cleansing line."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Henson is of course referring to the three collections within the Body by TPH line: The Cleanse + Condition Coalition, The Skin Stylers, and Restoration Situals.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Cleanse + Condition Coalition is a set of products designed to energize the body and mind in the morning. This includes the Good Daze Energizing Gel Body Cleanser ($9), The Ish Condish Nourishing In-Shower Conditioner ($9), The Leave-On Hydrating Daily Body Lotion ($9), and the It's Lit In The AM candle ($12). The candle features notes of ginger extract, mandarin, magnolia, jasmine, bourbon, coconut wood, sandalwood, and musk, and serves as the scent for this collection.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Skin Stylers collection features the Anything Glows Body Oil ($12), Watch Me Whip Hard Working Whipped Body Cream ($12), Softer Than a Mutha Decadent Skin Silkening Body Butter ($12), Baby Buff'd Body Scrub ($12), get their scents from the Anyplace, Anytime Candle ($12), which has notes of almond milk, Brazilian orange oil, lemon oil, Spanish citrus oil, blonde wood, light jasmine, tuberose, vanilla, heliotrope, and marshmallow musk. These products are essentials for any time of day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And then there's the Restoration Rituals to help you wind down at night. This lineup includes The Wind Down Relaxing Creamy Body Cleanser ($9), Bubble Or Nothin Comforting Bath Elixir ($9), Double Z's Dual Action Bath Soak & Body Scrub ($12), and the It's Lit In The PM Stress Relieving Evening Candle ($12), the scent of this collection. It comes with notes of lemon oil, fresh turmeric, rosewater, geranium oil, ylang-ylang, palo santo, coconut cream, and patchouli.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The packaging is minimal, chic, and Henson says the three neutral shades are inspired by different skin tones, which she hopes reiterates the fact that the line is for everybody. "It's clean and it reminds you of the spa," Henson says of the bottles and jars. "I came up with this neutral color palette because I was thinking of different colors of skin â€“ if you have skin it's for you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like the TPH haircare products, the body care line is also extremely accessible, which is important to Henson. Everything is priced $12 and under and is available at exclusively at Walmart stores and walmart.com.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Taking care of yourself doesn't have to be expensive," Henson says of the $12 and under price point. "Yes, the spa is there, but inflation is happening. People are having to cut back on things, but why should you have to cut back on self-care? It affects your mental health."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Taraji P. Henson's Latest Hairstyle Makes Her Look Exactly Like Janet Jackson in '97</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for which products you'll always find in Henson's own bathroom, which has become her sanctuary during the pandemic, she shares that she's particularly fond of Baby Buff'd.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm huge on body scrubs and sometimes when you use a sugar scrub, it's too thick and it leaves your skin feeling like you have a layer of grease on it and your clothes will get messed up," Henson explains. "I love that this is an exfoliating scrub that polishes your skin and leaves you moisturized, but it allows you space to layer more products on top. But you can also stop with the scrub and throw on your clothes and keep it pushing. Now I can't wait to take my shower."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Same, Taraji, same.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1oq5qqkZ%2B2bryMoZynq5%2BjeqO7w7Jkm7Fdqb2pecinq56qpp6yuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-gen-z-fear-they-will-raise-generation-terribly-behaved-ipad-kids-stoking-tiktok-debate-about.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Gen Z fear they will raise a generation of terribly behaved iPad kids, stoking TikTok deba</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./466163-rihannas-boyfriend-aap-rocky-rocks-knee-length-leather-skirt-prettiest-man-alive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Rihanna's Boyfriend A$AP Rocky Rocks Knee Length Leather Skirt: &amp;quot;Prettiest Man Alive&amp;quot;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
