In fact, sea moss contains a whopping 47 mg of iodine per gram serving, which translates into a healthier thyroid and immune system.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>Experts Say This Ancient Herb Can Help Rejuvenate a Weary Thyroid — And Your Energy</a></p><p>But that’s not all.&nbsp;“Sea moss has anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce inflammation in the blood vessels of the heart and support healthy blood flow,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">April Spencer, MD</a>, award-winning oncologist and former fellow at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.</a> “One of my favorite benefits of sea moss is that it helps support heart health,” she adds, noting that heart disease is the #1 killer of women.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to protecting your cardiovascular and immune function, sea moss has a third superpower, one that may explain its recent surge in popularity: weight loss.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/1_31606b.jpg><p>“Sea moss is praised for its potential to help with weight loss, although more research is needed to substantiate these claims,” says Dr. Dasgupta. “Its gel-like consistency may help you feel fuller for longer.”</p><p>An animal study published in the journal Nutrients found that consumption of macroalgae such as sea moss <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced insulin resistance</a>, fatty liver and other features of obesity. “Sea moss provides a number of benefits, from supporting weight management to optimal gut health and immunity,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Myers, MD</a>, functional medicine expert and founder of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Myers MD</a>.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>“</a></strong><a href=#>Black Seed Oil Is an Anti-Inflammatory Miracle Worker,” Says MD. After Seeing the Science, We Think You’ll Agree</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Easy ways to add sea moss into your diet</h2><p>If the thought of munching on raw seaweed doesn’t sound appealing, don’t stress. You can get the benefits of sea moss in a few ways.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Try supplements</h3><p>The easiest way to reap the benefits of this nutritional powerhouse is by taking a daily supplement. A brand to try: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elm & Rye</a>, known for their research-backed formulations and high-quality sourcing. They offer sea moss supplements in capsule form and as strawberry-flavored gummies.</p><p>You can also buy sea moss as a pre-made gel, such as&nbsp;this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">peach mango flavored gel</a>&nbsp;from Doublewood Supplements. The serving size is 1/2 tablespoon, and it can be consumed raw or added to a daily smoothie or juice. One tube contains 31 servings.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Take the DIY approach</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/Westend61SeaMoss.jpg><p>You can also buy sea moss in raw, dried form from retailers such as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Red’s Kitchen Sink</a>&nbsp;and prepare it yourself. This option is increasingly popular for weight management, as you can avoid the added sugars and gums that are common in premade formulations.&nbsp;</p><p>“The most common way to consume sea moss is by blending it into smoothies, juices, or&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">soups</a>,” says Dr. Spencer.&nbsp;“This helps retain its nutrients while making it easier to incorporate into your diet.”</p><p>Raw dried sea moss is tough and stiff, so you should prepare it for blending by rinsing it thoroughly and then letting it soak in a sealed container filled with clean water. Sea moss absorbs water and softens as it soaks, so you want to let it soak overnight, although 4 to 6 hours will do if you’re in a pinch. Once the sea moss is softened up, you can blend it directly or boil it into a gel.&nbsp;</p><p>To make a gel, simply add the softened sea moss to a saucepan and fill the saucepan with water until there’s about half an inch of water over the sea moss. Bring the water to a boil and let it simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the sea moss-water mixture has gelled.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How long does sea moss last?</h2><p>The shelf life of your sea moss depends on how it’s prepared. Sea moss supplements and premade gels will have an expiration date on the bottle. If you choose to buy raw sea moss and prepare it yourself, experts advise stick to small batches and tossing them after 3 to 5 days.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, be sure to follow the storage instructions on the product label. Raw, dried sea moss can be stored in a pantry, but once you’ve soaked it or made it into a gel, pop it in the fridge.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Buyer beware</h2><p>Although sea moss is largely safe for consumption, it’s important to pay attention to who you’re buying from.&nbsp;</p><p>“Be careful when consuming certain sea moss products, as they can be contaminated with toxic substances such as chlorine, heavy metals and pesticides,” says Dr. Myers. “It’s important to do your research and identify if it’s real or fake sea moss. Fake sea moss is often farmed in controlled environments using heavy chemicals during production, appearing lighter in color and having a heavy salt content.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=#>The Delicious Heavy Metal Detox Smoothie That’s Freeing Women From the Toxins That Make It Impossible to Lose Weight</a></p><p>Brands like Elm & Rye, Red’s Kitchen Sin, and Double Wood have reputations for being well-sourced and vetted by third-party chemical testing companies. Look for sea moss that’s consistent in texture and color, which runs from pale yellow to orange. Sea moss gels are typically a light yellow shade, similar to applesauce.</p><p>It’s also important to stick to the recommended product serving size, typically around a tablespoon. If you choose to prepare your own raw sea moss, don’t exceed more than two tablespoons per day to avoid&nbsp;overconsumption of iodine.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re unsure whether sea moss is right for you, don’t hesitate to consult your doctor or another healthcare expert.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For more on healthy supplements, click through the links below!</strong></p><p><a href=#>The Best Mitochondrial Dysfunction Supplements Can End That ‘Wired and Tired’ Feeling, Says MD</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Supplements for Older Women: Vitamins Women Over 50 Can Benefit From</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Best DHEA Supplements To Speed Weight Loss and Boost Mood: A Pharmacist and a Naturopath Weigh In</a></p><p>This content is not a substitute for professional medical advice or diagnosis.
