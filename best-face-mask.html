While <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>serums</a>, creams, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hydrating toners</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>cleansers</a> have played a big role in my skincare journey, face masks have ultimately made the most noticeable impact on my complexion. Although it has taken time for me to find the right face masks that effectively cater to my needs, I can confidently say that my hard work has paid off — my skin is the healthiest it has ever been, and it's all thanks to this extra self-care step.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily, I’m not the only one who can change their skin with the help of face masks. There are countless face masks on the market, complete with options specifically designed for different skin types and concerns. In order to find the best face masks, we recruited 21 testers to try and analyze 22 top-rated, bestselling products. Each tester reviewed the masks based on four important categories: Efficacy, feel, ease of application, and how the appearance of their skin changed after using the mask. After thorough testing that took place over two weeks, 12 face masks truly wowed us — with Rosen Skincare Smooth Jelly Mask being the overall favorite due to its affordable price point and dramatic results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No matter what kind of face mask you’re looking for —<strong> </strong>whether you want to transform your dry, oily, aging, or acne-prone skin — find the 12 best face masks, according to InStyle testers.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-rosen-skincare-smooth-jelly-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rosen Skincare Smooth Jelly Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ROSEN Skincare Smooth Jelly Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xxE0Y2SDoNL6CgIt_kYOiWQt1YI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rosen-skincare-smooth-jelly-mask-d1482870d71b4964854e01acc39ba87d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a face mask that does it all, you’re in luck: Rosen Skincare Smooth Jelly Mask goes above and beyond, addressing a handful of skincare concerns at once. Thanks to two powerhouse ingredients – <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lactic acid</a> and licorice root extract – this mask works to fade dark spots and even out skin texture. On top of that, it deeply exfoliates, sloughing away dead skin cells while also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>cleaning out pores</a>. The results? Bright, glowing skin that looks and feels smoother.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This face mask is pretty incredible, and I was quite surprised by the results I saw after my first use,” our tester says. “The texture of my skin and its brightness improved significantly.” Plus, she noticed that after using the mask for two weeks, her dark spots began to fade. “My skin looks much brighter and feels softer using this face mask,” she adds. “I also like that it helps with acne scarring and hyperpigmentation.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To get the most noticeable skin benefits, use this mask once a week. The texture is a bit thinner than you might expect (it’s more liquidy than jelly-like), so use two to three pumps as opposed to three to four as the label recommends. (This way you won’t waste any of the product.) Overall, we highly recommend this mask to anyone who is looking to give their skin some TLC. “It works as described, the application is efficient, and it's a GREAT value,” our tester shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients:</strong> Lactic acid, Licorice root extract, Cucumber extract, Passionfruit seed | <strong>Key Benefits: </strong>Exfoliates, resurfaces, and brightens | <strong>Size: </strong>2.2 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-the-inkey-list-madecassoside-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Inkey List Madecassoside Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Inkey List Madecassoside Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/RiaJWznJo2i2WjuIXxNPpStUbaE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madecassoside-mask-6480174463c948c889cecfee91df723c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>The Inkey List</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If there’s one skincare brand we can’t get enough of, it’s The Inkey List. This UK-based line features a slew of incredibly effective products, all for affordable prices. One of our favorite items from the collection happens to be the Madecassoside Mask. This hydrating mask cools the skin on contact, instantly reducing redness and inflammation. This is thanks to the key ingredient: Madecassoside – a component found within Centella Asiatica (a medicinal plant), which helps to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>reduce inflammation and redness</a>, as well as hydrate and plump skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This mask left my skin feeling smooth, refreshed, and soft,” our tester says. “It has a nice, instant cooling effect that is almost minty. It helped my skin tolerate some of my stronger skincare ingredients like retinoids and acids, and after using it for two weeks, my skin looks more even-toned and feels smoother.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pro tip: If your skin needs some extra hydration, keep this mask on for 30 minutes (as opposed to the recommended time of 10 minutes). When used as a leave-on treatment, it helps restore the skin’s barrier and lock in moisture. Though the formula is overall soothing, it’s worth noting that it does contain menthol, which has a strong scent and can irritate sensitive skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Madecassoside, Sunflower seed oil, Ginger root extract | <strong>Key Benefits: </strong>Hydrates and calms | <strong>Size:</strong> 1.7 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-sisley-paris-black-rose-cream-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sisley Paris Black Rose Cream Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sisley Paris Black Rose Cream Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GMrsCINwEcFKgpCR0iWut19MZAg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/black-rose-cream-mask-dda6174efd3f4b07a138d595e8a6a3e0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sisley Paris</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to splurging, there’s one brand we will gladly give our money to: Sisley Paris. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>luxe beauty line</a> features hair care, makeup, and skincare musts, but their masks really shine. And though it’s difficult to choose just one, the Black Rose Cream Mask just might be our favorite. This anti-aging formula is made with black rose (which smooths skin), padina pavonica (which refreshes and replenishes the complexion), and shea butter (which nourishes and soothes the skin’s barrier). What makes this product stand out is its ability to effectively diminish the signs of tired skin — it quickly revitalizes complexions, leaving skin glowy, dewy, and luminous.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This face mask worked well at hydrating,” says our tester. “There was a noticeable difference in my skin after using it: My skin feels softer, looks smoother, and is definitely plump.” She also notes that this product would be ideal for someone with aging and/or dry skin. “I noticed a difference in hydration levels after just one use. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mature skin</a> would highly benefit from the plumping action of this cream mask.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because the mask hydrates skin so deeply, it ultimately makes it more supple and helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, which means you’ll be able to enjoy long-lasting results. However, it’s worth noting that if you have acne-prone skin this mask might not be the best fit. This is because it’s made with ingredients (such as geranium essential oil and shea butter) that can sometimes clog pores.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Black rose, Padina pavonica, Shea butter<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Benefits: </strong>Plumps, hydrates, and brightens | <strong>Size: </strong>2 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brightening-tatcha-violet-c-radiance-mask></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Brightening</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tatcha Violet-C Radiance Mask</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Tatcha Violet-C Radiance Mask" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sDs4bOOpvLFzc2rFWd4Auixuvws=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/violet-c-radiance-mask-ae63e04453f040e9b825bb44817ac1a8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Application</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Feel</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Efficacy</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to glow, look no further than Tatcha Violet-C Radiance Mask. This bestselling product is safe for all skin types, and works to address uneven texture, lighten dark spots, and plump fine lines and wrinkles.

However, it’s worth noting that this mask contains silicones. Although silicones help give this product its creamy texture (which we love), they can also clog pores — so you may want to avoid this mask if you have blemish-prone skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“My skin looks and feels a lot smoother after using this face mask,” our tester says.

Made with turmeric extract to lighten hyperpigmentation and promote bright, glowing skin, it evens out skin tone both instantly and over time. Plus, it’s made with gritty mineral powder, which deeply exfoliates the skin and cleans out pores. As for the kicker, this mask is also formulated with aspen bark, a naturally occurring BHA that’s rich in salicylates and helps to visibly refine the skin’s texture. Thanks to these strategic ingredients, this product works quickly to make skin brighter, smoother, and healthier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This product says it brightens skin, and it does exactly that,” our tester confirms. “It purifies and removes dead skin cells, allowing your face to shine in the best way.

Made with 10 percent <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>niacinamide</a>, the mask first and foremost evens out skin texture and balances oil, but it’s also formulated with up-cycled blueberry seed oil, which renews and restores skin, making it brighter and smoother.

You’ll still get all the great benefits, even if you don’t leave it on overnight. While our tester didn’t experience any breakouts, it’s worth noting that some people with sensitive skin have said that this mask caused their skin to purge a bit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Niacinamide, Panthenol, Beta-glucan, Blueberry seed oil<strong> </strong>| <strong>Key Benefits: </strong>Hydrates, softens, and brightens<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-other-options-you-might-like></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Other Options You Might Like</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><a href=#>Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask</a></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re on BeautyTok, there’s a very good chance you’ve seen this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>viral Summer Fridays mask</a>.

However, she did notice that her skin wasn’t as dry as it was before she used it. “I think it refreshes the skin and feels nice, but I wouldn't say the results are drastic,” she adds.

Formulated with medical-grade ingredients, each product works to deliver impressive results to the skin. However, while we liked the brand’s Hydrating B5 Mask, our tester didn’t get the results she expected from a SkinCeuticals product. “I don't think the gel texture was working for my skin,” she reports. “I was expecting my skin to respond the way it does with creamy, moisturizing masks, but even immediately after rinsing off, my skin felt taut, and I needed to apply my moisturizer and a face oil overtop.” (It’s worth noting our tester has dry skin, which means this product might work better for someone with oily or combination skin since it’s a gel as opposed to a rich, hydrating cream.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nevertheless, this gel mask does have a majority of good reviews from other users.

However, individuals with oily, acne-prone skin will benefit from the exfoliating properties of salicylic acid and may want a more aggressive face mask to unclog pores and remove excess bacteria on the skin. [<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kate Somerville Exfolikate Intensive Pore Exfoliating Treatment</a> is ideal for acne-prone skin],” adds Brown. The bottom line: Be sure you’re using a mask that’s safe for your skin type and won’t ultimately irritate, clog, or harm it.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to face mask ingredients you should avoid, there are a few that generally top the list. “Stay away from parabens, alcohol, and fragrances in your masks,” warns Julia Gialanella, aesthetician at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Modrn Sanctuary</a>. This is because these ingredients can dry out skin, cause irritation, and trigger acne breakouts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the flip side, there are certain ingredients you should look for depending on your skin type. If you have dry skin, seek out ingredients that deeply nourish and moisturize. “The best ingredient for dry skin is hyaluronic acid,” says Gialanella. (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Peach Slices Snail Rescue Intensive Wash-Off Mask</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Glossier Moisturizing Moon Mask</a> both contain hyaluronic acid.) “It hydrates and rejuvenates the skin. Avocado or honey are great for dry skin as well.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the other hand, if you want to exfoliate your skin or clean out pores, look for a mask with ingredients such as alpha hydroxy, lactic, and/or salicylic acids. (Some masks with these ingredients include <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Peter Thomas Roth Pumpkin Enzyme Mask</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Then I Met You Rosé Resurfacing Facial Mask</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kate Somerville Exfolikate Intensive Pore Exfoliating Treatment</a>.) Alternatively, if you have sensitive skin, opt for soothing ingredients like aloe vera or calendula extract. (You can find both of these in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kiehl's Calendula Petal-Infused Calming Mask</a>.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why should you use a face mask?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Face masks offer a wide variety of benefits. “They can be a form of cleansing (exfoliation) or relaxation rituals, or used for moisturizing purposes as well offering healing power for a variety of skin issues from sun damage to inflammatory skin conditions,” says dermatologist Dr. Vladyslava Doktor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Face masks can be an excellent way to quickly hydrate and brighten your overall complexion or even target specific skin concerns such as acne,” adds Brown. “If you have dry, sensitive skin and need a boost in moisture, I recommend applying a gentle face mask one to three times a week for proper nourishment. However, if your goal is to take care of an acne flare or clogged pores, then use a clarifying mask with salicylic or glycolic acid for overall skin resurfacing once a week.” Essentially, face masks can treat and address different skin concerns.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How often should you use a face mask?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How often you use a face mask depends on the results you are trying to achieve. “Masks can definitely be used daily or just a few times a week,” explains Dr. Doktor. “For instance, traditional <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>clay masks</a> can be used daily, but exfoliating masks should be used a few times a week. They can strip the top layer of the skin and provide a constant source of irritation if applied daily.” Be sure you are also paying attention to the manufacturer’s instructions for how often you should use a specific face mask so you don’t unintentionally harm your skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to the results you are trying to achieve, it’s also important to take your skin type into consideration. “Typically, I always recommend [using a face mask] one to two times weekly for upkeep, however for some, I might recommend using one on an as-needed basis,” says Sarah Akram, master esthetician and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Sarah Akram Skincare</a>. “If your lifestyle allows it and you’re able to accumulate a range of different face masks bespoke to you — you can mask every single night or multiple times a week.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do face masks expire?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, face masks expire. “This depends on whether they have any preservatives or are made from fresh ingredients,” says Dr. Doktor. (Also, it’s worth noting that most beauty products expire – including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>makeup</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>perfume</a> – so be sure you check how long the product can last.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of cheap masks on the market and without being careful, these may cause breakouts, rosacea flares, and dermatitis. If you notice any excessive tingling or irritation when masking, you should immediately remove the mask and cleanse the skin with cool water.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, face masks are an effective and relaxing way to target specific skin concerns. “Choose the mask that is right for your skin, whether it's boosting hydration, brightening dark spots,&nbsp; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>treating acne</a>, etc, and add it to your routine one or two nights a week,” says Gialanella. “You’ll start to see a difference, and it’s like a mini spa night at home!”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-instyle-picks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is InStyle Picks?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Did you notice the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>InStyle Picks seal of approval</a> at the top of this story?
