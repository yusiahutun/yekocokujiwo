It might still have music you no longer possess in any other form. If that's the case, grab your old music player because you can transfer the music from your iPod to your computer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To do so, you just need to consider your iPod as an external drive from which you can take music. Once extracted from the iPod, you can add music to your iTunes or Apple Music library and even sync it with your iPhone. We'll show you how below.</p><h2 id=step-1-prevent-itunes-or-finder-from-automatically-syncing-with-your-device>Step 1. Prevent iTunes or Finder From Automatically Syncing With Your Device</h2><p>First, you'll need to make sure you can transfer the music on your iPod without iTunes or Finder erasing it while syncing.</p><p>When you connect a device to iTunes or Finder, the music in your library automatically syncs to your device. You cannot download music from an iPod (or iPhone or iPad) into iTunes or Music. So, if you connect an iPod to your computer, the music on the device will be overwritten with what's in your iTunes or Music library.</p><p>The method for preventing iTunes from automatically syncing with your iPod is mostly the same for Windows and Macs running Mojave or earlier:</p><li>Make sure to disconnect all iOS devices from your computer. Then, open iTunes on your computer.</li><li>In Windows, go to <strong>Edit > Preferences</strong>. On a Mac, go to <strong>iTunes > Preferences</strong>.</li><li>On both platforms, click the <strong>Devices</strong> tab and check the <strong>Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically</strong> box.</li><li>Then click <strong>OK</strong> and close iTunes.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/itunes-device-preferences-in-windows.jpg><p>However, Macs running macOS Catalina and newer use Finder instead of iTunes to sync iOS devices. Because of this, you'll need to open your device in Finder after connecting it using a USB cable and uncheck the <strong>Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected</strong> box.</p><h2 id=step-2-copy-music-from-your-ipod-to-your-computer>Step 2. Copy Music From Your iPod to Your Computer</h2><p>Now, you can connect your iPod to your computer. It should show up as a drive in <strong>File Explorer</strong> on Windows and <strong>Finder</strong> on a Mac. Open the iPod drive and navigate to the <strong>iPod_Control > Music</strong> folder. You'll see many folders labeled with an <strong>F</strong> and a number. If your iPod drive appears empty, you need to <a href=#>reveal hidden files and folders on your computer</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Windows users can click the <strong>View</strong> tab and select the <strong>Hidden items</strong> option. Mac users can hold down <strong>Cmd + Shift + Period (.)</strong> to toggle hidden folders on or off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/itunesnano_musicfolders-1.JPG><p>Now, select all the folders in the <strong>iPod_Control > Music</strong> folder and copy and paste them to a location on your hard drive. This will transfer your music from your iPod to your computer. The files all have random four-letter file names.</p><p>If you're on a Windows PC, you can see the tags for each music file in File Explorer. If tags aren't visible, enable them by holding down <strong>Alt + Shift + P</strong> to bring up the details pane. Alternatively, you can select it from the <strong>View</strong> tab. Unfortunately, you can't see the tag information on a Mac.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/itunesnano_taginfo-1.JPG><p>Once you've copied the files, you can eject the iPod and disconnect it. Right-click on the iPod drive in File Explorer on Windows and select <strong>Eject</strong>. Mac users should Control-click the iPod icon on the desktop and select <strong>Eject</strong>.</p><p>Before bringing your files into iTunes on Windows, make sure you know <a href=#>how to import invalid MP3 files into iTunes on Windows</a>.</p><h2 id=step-3-add-music-to-your-itunes-library>Step 3. Add Music to Your iTunes Library</h2><p>After transferring the music from your iPod to your computer, you can start making adjustments. First, add the music from your iPod to your iTunes library on your Windows PC or Mac. Note that your music library appears in the Apple Music app since iTunes isn't available on macOS Catalina and newer versions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To add some or all of the music from your iPod to your iTunes library, go to either <strong>File > Add File to Library</strong> or <strong>File > Add Folder to Library</strong> in iTunes for Windows. If you're using a Mac, go to <strong>File > Add to Library</strong> from the menu bar. Then, select the files or folder you want to add. You can also add music to iTunes by dragging music files from File Explorer or Finder to the iTunes window.</p><p>By default, adding items to your iTunes library on Windows creates a reference to the file's current location. The original file remains in its current location. Thus, if you were to move the original files, iTunes would no longer see them.</p><p>You can have iTunes for Windows make a copy of each file and place it into the iTunes media folder. Moving the original files would then not affect the music in your iTunes library.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To do this, open iTunes for Windows and go to <strong>Edit > Preferences</strong>. Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab and check the <strong>Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library</strong> box. To organize your iTunes Media folder into artist and album folders, check the <strong>Keep iTunes Media folder organized</strong> box. This option is checked by default in iTunes for Mac (on Mojave and earlier).</p><p>Once enabled, all media added to your iTunes library from then on will copy directly to the iTunes media folder. Now, you won't have to worry about moving the original files anywhere else. Just remember, media added to your iTunes library before enabling that checkbox still links to the original media files.</p><p>To copy the remaining media files linked to your iTunes library, go to <strong>File > Library > Organize Library</strong> and check the <strong>Consolidate files</strong> box. Then, click <strong>OK</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/itunesnano_organizelibrary_oldnanofiles-1.JPG> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=step-4-create-a-playlist-in-itunes>Step 4. Create a Playlist in iTunes</h2><p>If you use playlists on your iPhone, you can create them in iTunes, which will sync to your iPhone. The procedure remains the same whether you're on a Mac or Windows PC.</p><p>To create a playlist, select the songs you want in the playlist. Then right-click (Control-click on a Mac) on the selected songs and select <strong>Add to Playlist > New Playlist</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/itunesnano_addsongstoplaylist-1.JPG><p>For similar songs (such as an album), the playlist is created using the artist and album title as the name. You'll need to enter a custom name if you create a playlist from various songs. To change the playlist's name, click on the title and type a new one. You can also rearrange the songs in the playlist by dragging and dropping them to different positions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=step-5-transfer-music-to-your-iphone>Step 5. Transfer Music to Your iPhone</h2><p>To transfer the added music to your iPhone, make sure iTunes or Finder is open and connect your device to your computer. Then, click the device icon in the iTunes toolbar or select your device from the Finder sidebar (on macOS Catalina and newer versions).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sync-music-option-in-itunes.jpg><p>If you want to quickly sync content to your iPhone, you can use iTunes to sync your entire music library. Alternatively, it gives you the option to sync selected playlists, artists, albums, and genres.</p><p>In case you see a <strong>Replace and Sync</strong> message, remember that doing so will allow the iTunes library to replace everything on your iPhone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To sync your entire library, click <strong>Music</strong> in the sidebar on the left under <strong>Settings</strong>. If you're using <a href=#>Finder on macOS</a>, you'll find the <strong>Music</strong> option on the right pane after you select your device.</p><p>Then, make sure to select <strong>Sync Music</strong> on the right and select <strong>Entire music library</strong>. Now, press the <strong>Apply</strong> button in the lower-right corner. If syncing doesn't begin, you can press the <strong>Sync</strong> button.</p><p>Meanwhile, if you don't like iTunes and want to expand past your old library, check out the <a href=#>best music download apps for your iPhone and Android</a>.</p><h2 id=transferring-music-from-an-old-ipod-to-your-computer-isn-39-t-that-hard>Transferring Music From an Old iPod to Your Computer Isn't That Hard</h2><p>If your old iPod still charges enough to use, you can easily transfer music from that iPod to your computer with a little bit of time and effort. After all, we didn't have iCloud back in the iPod days for convenience.</p><p>After transferring music from your iPod to iTunes or your iPhone, give it a new purpose. Consider reusing your old iPod as an ebook reader or a secondary music collection holder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fqb%2BiutKfnKtlnarAqq%2BMoqeonF2YvK681K2cq2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jenee-fleenor-2020-cma-awards-covid-19.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jenee Fleenor Has COVID-19, Drops Out of 2020 CMA Awards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dan-hughes-bio-wiki-salary-net-worth-married-children.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dan Hughes Bio, Wiki, Salary, Net Worth, Married &amp;amp; Children</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
