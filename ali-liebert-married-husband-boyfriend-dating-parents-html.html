She also landed a leading role&nbsp;in the 2009 film,&nbsp;Year of the Carnivore.</p><p>With her promising career and immense beauty, it wouldn't be foolish to believe that she must be enjoying a dating life. But who is the lucky man—ahem, the lucky person? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Well,&nbsp;it seems,&nbsp; Ali&nbsp;won't have a lucky man but a lucky woman. During an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">AfterEllen</a>&nbsp;back in 2013, she was asked if she's ever had a&nbsp;crush&nbsp;on a woman, and the answer made her male fans' hearts shattered, who desired to be the boyfriend of this beauty.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“When I’m attracted to someone, I’m attracted to them and yes, I’ve definitely been attracted to women in real life. Doing research is one of my favorite parts of the job as an actor and luckily there are so many resources to draw from – books, the internet, real people. Talking to lesbians who lived through the war, or have lived in homes or places that were homophobic was especially helpful as I was creating and understanding Betty’s point of view of the world.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Armed with real-life experience and intensive research, Ali awed her fans by portraying the role of Betty McRae, a lesbian, in the TV series&nbsp;Bomb Girls. Similarly, she further amused her fans, playing another character of the same sexual orientation in Lost Girl.</p><p>But Ali made her fans swoon back in 2015&nbsp;by going public about her relationship with her girlfriend, Charlie. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Ali Liebert took Instagram to share a photograph with her partner&nbsp;Charlie, enjoying the holiday of the lovers, Valentine's Day together in apparent bliss.</p><p>On the same day, Charlie also uploaded a picture with Ali. The couple seemed to have enjoyed their time together, as the flaunted photos reflect&nbsp;their passion for each other. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Well, these above pictures were uploaded a few years ago, and as for now, none of Ali's social&nbsp;media accounts&nbsp;have any signs of the couple being&nbsp;together. But, Ali might&nbsp;secretly be&nbsp;dating or married to her&nbsp;or someone else, who knows?</p><p>When Bomb Girls first debuted,&nbsp;Ali explicitly identified as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">straight</a> and claimed to be very much in love with her boyfriend. But she was&nbsp;an active&nbsp;supporter of LGBT rights. Over the years, much like with so many of us, her perception of her sexuality evolved.</p><p>The talented Ali has been the recipient of a Canadian Screen Award and a Leo Award for her performance in Bomb Girls. Besides, she was also listed in the Hollywood Reporter's "Next Generation 15 Hottest Canadian Talents Under 35." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Talking about her family, the beautiful diva has a younger brother, Jeff, but is yet to disclose any information about her parents.</p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Stay with us</a> for further updates on Ali Liebert!</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpqkmWK5qrHBnqmtZZ2Wv7O1xJ1koa2jl66vsIybprKeop6yr7CMnZitoZ6cerGt0Z6lratencGuuA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-fast-times-shia-labeouf.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt Recreate 'Fast Times' Flirty Dream Sequence During All-Star Table Rea</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chance-perdomo-dead-stars-react-gen-v-sabrina-star-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chance Perdomo Dead at 27, Stars Mourn Death of 'Gen V' Actor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
