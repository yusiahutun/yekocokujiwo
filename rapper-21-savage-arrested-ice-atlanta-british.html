He actually came to the US from the UK as a teen and overstayed his visa."</p><p>Abraham-Joseph has previously spoken about growing up in "beat-up a** apartments" in Atlanta with his mum named Heather and four brothers and six sisters.</p><p>In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>The Fader</a>, he claimed he was banned from all schools after bringing a gun to class when he was 12 or 13.</p><p>He said: "I probably broke the record for the youngest n***** to bring a gun to that school."</p><p>The rapper also appears to have an interest in air travel.</p><p>Old reports state he has a fear of flying and being "hijacked" but he has also pursued his own flying license and took the controls of a small private plane during a flight to Miami in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000466398822.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000466378630-e1549253871348.jpg><p><b>We pay for your stories!
