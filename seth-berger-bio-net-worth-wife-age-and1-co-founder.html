This couldn’t have been better depicted in Netflix’s </span><i><span>Untold: The Rise and Fall of AND1</span></i><span> — the story about how the international basketball brand </span><i><span>AND1</span></i><span> quickly shattered apart. And it had much to do with the brand’s co-founder Seth Berger.</span></p><p><span>So, who’s he? Keep scrolling this Seth Berger Bio to learn everything about him.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Meet Seth Berger, The AND1 Co-Founder On Netflix’s </b><b><i>Untold: The Rise and Fall of AND1</i></b></h3><p><span>Seth Berger was almost unknown to the world until Netflix’s </span><i><span>Untold: The Rise and Fall of AND1</span></i><span> premiered in August 2022. This documentary on the street style-inspired, influential basketball brand bought back memories of when </span><i><span>AND1</span></i><span> sneakers and streetball were trending in the 90s. And it seems Seth was the man behind it.</span></p><p><span>From an early age, Seth was passionate about basketball. He even went as far as to play a year of junior varsity basketball and then collegiate football at the </span><i><span>University of Pennsylvania</span></i><span>. However, he chose politics upon earning his Bachelor’s degree in Economics in 1989 and went on to serve </span><i><span>Capitol Hill</span></i><span> for two years before enrolling at </span><i><span>Wharton</span></i><span> for his MBA.</span></p><p><span>But that didn’t mean he quit basketball. “I probably spent four to eight hours hooping for every hour I spent studying,” he recalled. Waking up every day thinking about basketball, Seth then began thinking of ways he could build his own basketball business.</span></p><p><span>So, in 1993, the same year as his graduation, Seth, his childhood friend (</span><i><span>Stanford </span></i><span>graduate) Jay Gilbert, and fellow </span><i><span>Wharton </span></i><span>hooper Tom Austin launched </span><i><span>AND1</span></i><span> by trading in trash-talking apparel. Eventually, the brand then dabbled in sneakers and streetball, and before they knew it, </span><i><span>AND1</span></i><span> was the next big thing.</span></p><h3><b>Seth Berger Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>Seth Berger flaunted a net worth of above $15 million in 2022.</span></p><p><span>The ex-CEO of </span><i><span>AND1</span></i><span> has certainly made a fortune from the company. But his career didn’t end when he sold everything in 2005 due to a lack of revenue prior to it being too late. Infact, just the year he parted ways with </span><i><span>AND1</span></i><span>, Seth took on a part-time CEO role for another start-up, </span><i><span>Lightning Poker</span></i><span>. There, he helped the company to raise $1 million in the financing, created an automated poker table, and negotiated an international distribution deal with Shufflemaster, all within a year!</span></p><p><span>In 2007, Seth then joined </span><i><span>The Westtown School</span></i><span> as its Head Boys Basketball Coach, and he continued doing so for over 15 years. Reportedly, his teams have a 73 percent win rate, and they won their league title nine times and the state championships in 2016, 2017, 2020, and 2022.</span></p><p><span>Between his coaching, from 2011 to 2012, Seth also funded a small venture in the mobile gaming space, </span><i><span>GravyTrain</span></i><span>. Sadly, although the idea was executed well, the market for these games started to crash, and Seth shut down the business.</span></p><p><span>Also, in 2016, he joined </span><i><span>Sixers Innovation Lab Crafted</span></i><span> by Kimball as its managing director.</span></p><h3><b>Seth Berger Wife</b></h3><p><span>Seth Berger married his wife Christelle (nee Williams) Berger on September 15, 1996. The two first met while they were both attending the </span><i><span>University of Pennsylvania</span></i><span>. At the time, Seth was still with </span><i><span>AND1</span></i><span> while Christelle was a track and field star.</span></p><p><span>Fast forward to over 25 years later, the duo was happier than ever. “25 years down, Infiniti to go. Wife, best friend, the greatest teammate in the world, My Queen of Spades. God Blessed me with you and I am forever grateful. Happy Anniversary CW, I Love You To The Moon And Back,” Seth posted on his IG on his 25th anniversary.</span></p><p><span>But that wasn’t the only time, Seth praised his wife. From holidays to birthdays, Christelle often graced his husband’s socials.</span></p><p><span>Christelle turned 55 on February 17, 2022. She worked as a track and field coach then.</span></p><p><b>Trivia: </b><span>Christelle is the daughter of Dan Williams (died: March 23, 2014) and Rosie Williams.</span></p><h3><b>How Many Kids Does Seth Berger Have?</b></h3><p><span>Seth Berger and his wife Christelle share three kids (all sons) — Cole, Tyler (TJ), and Quin Berger.</span></p><p><span>All of them are adults now and are above 6 feet (183 cm). To be precise, Tyler turned 20 on November 13, 2021, and Cole turned 23 on April 12, 2022.</span></p><p><span>Like their father, both Tyler (TJ) and Quin are basketball players while Cole worked as an investment banker in NYC.</span></p><p><span>Talking more about them, Cole studied at </span><i><span>Lafayette College</span></i><span>, Tyler played for </span><i><span>San Diego Toreros</span></i><span> men’s basketball, and Quin was signed with </span><i><span>Saint Joseph’s</span></i><span>. Both Tyler and Quin played the point guard position and had a star rating above 2 stars.</span></p><p><span>Here are their socials — Cole @</span><a href=#><span>cole_2333</span></a><span>, Tyler @</span><a href=#><span>teege20</span></a><span>, and Quin @</span><a href=#><span>quinberger</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Seth Berger Age</b></h3><p><span>Seth Berger was born in November 1967. That made him 54 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>Also, that means, he was 25 when he co-founded </span><i><span>AND1</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span> Seth’s a Democrat. He absolutely hates Trump — so much that he even posed “peace out, bi*tch” outside</span><i><span> Trump International Hotel</span></i><span> in Honolulu Hawaii.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Seth Berger From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Seth hails from the Upper East Side of New York.
