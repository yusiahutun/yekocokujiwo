All of these files are easy to print and most can be printed on relatively small 3D printers.</p><h2 id=3d-printable-easter-eggs>3D Printable Easter Eggs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/easter-3d-printed-eggs.jpg><p>When most people think about Easter, eggs will be one of the first things that come to mind. Easter eggs don't have to be made from chocolate, and we think that you'll agree that the 3D printable Easter eggs we have chosen will be more than enough to put a smile on your children's faces.</p><h3 id=1-varied-easter-egg-collection-by-antonin-nosek>1) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Varied Easter Egg Collection by Antonin_Nosek</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/3d-printable-easter-egg-collection.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This collection of patterned eggs is a great place to start when you are looking for Easter Inspiration. These eggs would make great decorations, while also offering a safe and hygienic option for Easter egg hunts, all with the option to print each egg in its own bright and vibrant color. These eggs are very easy to print without support materials, and they can even be printed hollow to make the prints faster.</p><h3 id=2-surprise-egg-1---tiny-haul-truck-by-agepbiz>2) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Surprise Egg #1 - Tiny Haul Truck by Agepbiz</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/3d-printable-digger-egg.jpg><p>Unlike any Easter egg you will have ever seen, this next option comes with a cute little surprise inside it. The example we have linked contains a tiny haul truck, but there are variations of this egg with different types of machinery inside. This makes a cute and quirky joke gift for Easter, but you will need to work hard to <a href=#>get the right 3D printer settings</a> to achieve the same results as the images.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=3-hollow-easter-egg-container-by-jooxoe3i>3) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollow Easter Egg Container by Jooxoe3i</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/3d-printable-hollow-egg.jpg><p>Perfect to be filled with candy, toys, and other exciting Easter gifts, this hollow Easter egg STL file is an egg hunt organizer's dream come true. This 3D model is easy to print and great for those who want to avoid sweet treats this Easter.

The whole basket prints flat, but this means that you need to use glue or epoxy to secure the basket rings and handle in place once it has finished printing. You can find a handy video on the Thingiverse page to help you to build it.</p><h3 id=6-makersome-39-s-easter-basket-by-makersome>6) <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Makersome's Easter Basket by Makersome</a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/3d-printable-egg-basket.jpg><p>The final Easter egg basket on our list is another easy one to print.
