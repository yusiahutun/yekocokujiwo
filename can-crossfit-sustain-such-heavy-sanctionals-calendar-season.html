As the length and size of the season has increased, many questions come with it and the Filthy 150 will serve as a starting place towards answering some of them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">How will the first-year sanctioned events compare to the ones that are in their second season? We live and we learn. We make mistakes and we grow from them. The question is, will the new Sanctionals have learned from the mistakes made last season, or will they make similar mistakes in year one?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the case of the Filthy 150, expect to see relatively little in terms of mistakes. This is a competition that has been around for a long time, but they also have the experience of putting on two live Open announcements (one last spring, and one less than a month ago). Potential mistakes for first-year competitions include broadcasting, and the Filthy 150 has an advantage to expect a high level of production that is accessible and informative for fans around the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Will the longer season dilute the athlete pool at some of the smaller competitions? Definitely yes, but I don't think we have to worry about that much for the Filthy 150. Because of its proximity to the close of the Open, its position as the first Sanctioned event of the season, and its location (Europe) which isn’t too difficult to get to, we can expect a solid roster of athletes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There have been three times as many confirmed male athletes announced as females, but all of them boast impressive resumes and will attract fans’ interest in the competition. For the men we have Games veterans Lukas Esslinger, Chandler Smith, Adrian Mundwiler and previous Sanctional champions Sean Sweeney, Matt McLeod and Jonne Koski. Then there is the always entertaining, newly minted Russian national champion and former regional champion Roman Khrennikov, and the much anticipated return to competition for one of the most beloved men in CrossFit, Dan Bailey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/19/3b78b7c4-0a7f-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_1320x770_153532.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the women’s side only four athletes have yet to be announced, but they are an impressive group: reigning second fittest on earth Kristin Holte, 10th fittest on earth Thuri Helgadottir, and two women who need no introduction, Sam Briggs and Sara Sigmundsdottir.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Briggs suffered an injury mid-Open, but she was healthy enough to put up the second best female time worldwide on 20.5, which indicates she just might recover in time to compete in Ireland. Sigmundsdottir is coming in fresh off winning the Open for the second time this calendar year and the third time in her career.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Is there enough interest to support this many Sanctionals and this long of a season? Perhaps the most important of the three questions, this is the one we will ultimately have to wait longest for an answer. My instinct says that locally, a majority, if not all of these events can succeed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/11/19/1fbde928-0a9d-11ea-afcd-7b308be3ba45_1320x770_153532.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, from an international interest perspective, there will be massive differences in the size of audience and level of interest. The major competitions will draw the most high-profile athletes, the biggest sponsorships, offer the most money and have exponentially more people tuning in.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There will be interest and intrigue for a majority of the other competitions as well, but I anticipate a handful of Sanctioned events to be running thin on big-name athletes and have little appeal or draw in terms of the online community.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While we wait for the Open results to be finalised, fans have plenty to get excited about. November 22 marks the start of this season’s Sanctionals calendar, and there’s no reason to expect anything less than a professional, exciting, well-run, action-packed competition for all to enjoy coming out of Ireland.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqK2kmbywvo6cqairo5u2tXvAq6uim5yafHR8knFqcmtfmK6vecKrpqyrlp7Bbr%2FUrKuaoZ5iwLavx2afnpmmrnq0rc2cq6Knnpa5tHnCmqOeppSWv26%2FxJqqqKY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./playboy-model-flaunts-unreal-assets-29704149.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Playboy model flaunts 'unreal' assets in racy bikini to mark special occasion</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meghan-roche.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meghan Roche</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
