His team has been storming the league, and with his recent touchdown over the weekend, he’s feeling himself. But not as much as his brother was feeling his ‘fit for the pre-game socials. As the duo discuss his stylish threads, Travis Kelce admitted he does have another dream job, and it involves Wes Anderson.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> is a fan of clothes. <a href=#>Fashion</a> – he loves it. Fans do too. Swifties were shaking in their chairs when they saw him wear outfits associated to <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>. Remember when he wore the co-ord denim set, resembling 1989? Or how about the bold choice of wearing <a href=#>fabric that looked like her curtains</a> when she unveiled the Midnights track list on <a href=#>TikTok</a>? He knows what he’s doing. But his recent pre-game outfit was up for discussion with his brother Jason Kelce, and it’s here where Travis brought up filmmaker Wes Anderson.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-calls-out-wes-anderson-give-me-the-lines-baby>Travis Kelce calls out Wes Anderson – ‘give me the lines, baby’</h2><p>During the latest New Heights <a href=# rel=nofollow>podcast</a>, Jason and Travis were talking about the recent game between the Chiefs and Bills.</p><p>First, his brother asks Trav if he has any thoughts over Sunday’s game, which the athlete ‘tips his head’ to the Bills for playing a spectacular game. He also praised the fans for the ‘electric’ atmosphere.</p><p>Then he shows Travis’ pre-game outfit, telling him he’s “known” for his ‘fits.</p><p>The duo then laugh at the fact his shirt looked like a Cheescake Factory bag, which the company, of course, took advantage of on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>Jason replies: “I saw that too, I thought it reminded me of something, there was that, to me, I got more vibes that this was a Wes Anderson style.”</p><p>Trav, smiling, adds: “That’s pretty good.”</p><p>Jason then explains further: “The beanie, everything, it kind of looked like from The Life Aquatic, probably what gave me that idea.”</p><p>But the 34-year-old was feeling it too: “Dude, that would be pretty electric.”</p><p>“It wasn’t aimed as a knock, Wes Anderson is a beast,” Jason chimes in.</p><p>“That’s what I’m saying, if I am in a Wes Anderson film, if this was my pitch, I’m just going to go ahead and say it to get on a Wes Anderson film,” Travis pleaded to the camera, smirking.</p><p>“I could fight right in Wes, you just give me the lines baby.”</p><p>Jason then called it ‘picturesque’, complimenting his younger brother.</p><p>It was a custom suit, made by Teddy Von Ranson, which apparently “fit like a glove”. Travis ‘mashed’ it with the hat and boot, in a combo he had ‘lying around’.</p><p>“Wanted to make sure everyone knew we were going into Buffalo in business attire,” Trav says.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jason-wanted-to-make-the-worst-best-impression-for-taylor>Jason wanted to make the ‘worst’ best impression for Taylor</h2><p>In the podcast, they, of course, had to discuss Jason ripping his shirt off, jumping into the crowd and partying with strangers in their seats after <a href=#>Travis scored a touchdown</a> in the second quarter.</p><p>The photos and clips of Jason celebrating went viral on pretty much every social media platform.</p><p>Travis tells his brother he wished he could see his wife Kylie’s reaction to his antics. But Jason explains, she knew it was going to happen because he gave her a ‘heads up’. But to be clear, he didn’t ask permission.</p><p>Apparently, Kylie told him to be on his best behavior because they were meeting Taylor in the suite for the game. But Jason explained he met his future wife “blackout drunk” and fell asleep at the bar. Therefore, he likes to ensure first impressions are the best ‘worst’ he can give. The reason? So it can only go uphill from there.</p><p>We feel you, Jace.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eEcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGarnpmjmsBuuc6voKefXZ67tbuMrZ%2BeZZ2kw6qxjJusrKGemsC0edaiq6FllKeyormMq6alnV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-are-reloaded-repacked-games.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Are Reloaded Games and Repacked Games?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./travis-kelce-didnt-want-to-marry-taylor-swift-in-funny-quiz-he-preferred-katy-perry.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Travis Kelce 'didn't want to marry' Taylor Swift in funny quiz - he preferred Katy Perry</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
