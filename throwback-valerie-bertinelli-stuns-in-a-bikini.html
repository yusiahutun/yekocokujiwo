The TV star stunned in a green two-piece bikini that showed off her amazing figure and skin-toned abs. Although she was 48 years old, Valerie’s beauty shone on the cover.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.vZPkxdBJhhZ5_s-LRGrq2gHaJ0&pid=15.1"><p>However, despite the beauty and aura that the Tv star displayed, appearing on the cover was more personal for Valerie. It was the first time in almost 30 years that she had worn a bikini. Speaking 11 years after the cover was released, Valerie <a href=#>said</a>:&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=3.5><p><strong>“There’s a lot of pride and a lot of shame associated with that cover. I worked really, really, really hard. Physically definitely. I wish to God I had worked just as hard on my mental shape. But when I don’t work on what’s eating me, I’m going to start eating.”</strong></p></figure><p>The TV star went on a Jenny Craig diet for nine months to achieve the body that Valerie displayed on that cover. She also worked out a lot, doing several stomach crunches, resulting in Valerie losing more than 40 lbs.&nbsp;</p><p>Valerie has dealt with weight issues for most of her life, and her difficult relationship often left her in despair. However, the Tv star has never tried to avoid her issues with weight and has always been very open about it.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Valeries_Struggles_With_Food_Addiction></span><strong>Valerie’s Struggles With Food Addiction</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Valerie is the proud host of Food Network’s “Cooking with Valerie,” the Tv star once struggled with food addiction. During an interview with Dr. Oz in 2012, Valerie <a href=#>confessed</a>:&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=3><p><strong>“I used food as a crutch, and I abused food in a way that I shouldn’t have. It made me afraid of food for a while, too, but now I embrace it.”</strong></p></figure><p>Still, cultivating a positive attitude towards eating took work for Valerie. It took years for her to be comfortable and find a balance between eating and how it affected her weight. The famous chef noted that because her weight fluctuates, there are times she would indulge way too much in food. However, at other times she would reduce her food intake because it all depends on listening to the body.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Valeries_Struggles_With_Body_weight></span><strong>Valerie’s Struggles With Body weight&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/1a/7b/48/1a7b482ee42cf6bd6af886abcfd8cd54.jpg><p>After Valerie released her memoir “Enough Already,” the TV star sat down with PEOPLE to discuss one of the most vital aims of the book, her “weight.” In the interview, Valerie shared how her body image issues started in her childhood. The renowned chef <a href=#>revealed</a>:</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=2><p><strong>“I watched my father treat my mother badly when she would gain weight. I had a 5th-grade teacher poke my belly and say, ‘You want to keep an eye on that.’”</strong></p></figure><p>Valerie explained how this whole experience made her spend decades thinking that she had to look a certain way for people to like and accept her, and how unlovable she would be if she gained weight. Her rise in Hollywood also intensified Valerie’s issues with weight, and after starring in “One Day at a Time,” the actress would compare herself to costar Mackenzie Philips.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Valerie’s insecurity heightened when a reporter said she looked like “a ton of lard” standing next to Mackenzie. No matter how hard she pretended, Valerie always thought she was a failure within herself. The Tv star also failed to deal with her issues adequately and instead tried losing weight using unhealthy means. Although she successfully lost 50 pounds, Valerie admitted she was starving herself and doing workouts twice a day. But, unfortunately, she wasn’t taking care of the most important things; her head and heart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Valerie_Is_Learning_To_Love_Her_Weight></span><strong>Valerie Is Learning To Love Her Weight&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>However, as she grows older, Valerie has learned to be comfortable with her weight. Although she weighs more during her 60s than when she was younger, the Tv star no longer feels insecure. She <a href=#>explained</a>:&nbsp;</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=2><p><strong>“What I’m learning is that your body is not what makes you lovable. We’re all part of this diet culture that isn’t actually helping us, our mental or emotional health.”</strong></p></figure><p>However, <a href=#>Valerie</a> noted she was trying to unlearn everything ingrained in her. She had become committed to doing the internal work required to feel comfortable in her body. She knows how overwhelming judging oneself based on weight and body image can be.&nbsp;</p><p>She also hopes that her story will help others in the same condition who feels the same way she once did to unlearn all the wrong things they must have been taught about body weight and the actionable ways of coping with weight insecurities. As for the green bikini, Valerie keeps it tucked away in a closet drawer. According to her, everybody’s shape is what people should be celebrating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwam%2BzrCZmpubYsOiuMSroJ5lkpq%2FtbXNnqOloV2owba60magp2WRYq%2Bqt8inoGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zoe-pastelle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zoe Pastelle - Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Facts, Nationality</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./suit-not-dead-its-getting-more-casual-say-tailors-amid.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The suit is not dead but its getting more casual, say tailors amid comfort wears rise and the</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
