I always carry prayer cards to St Jude and St Martha with me. Both the boys have had communions and been confirmed. James doesn’t go to church any more, but Lennon comes with me. I had a spiritual awakening five years ago when I learned how to meditate in Thailand and God knows that it’s helped me over the last 18 months.</span></p><h2><span>My father was involved with the Krays.</span></h2><p><span>I was under no illusion about that. He also dealt with the equally infamous Richardson family and in fact Reggie was godfather to my older brother Jamie. My father was flawed, but I loved him nevertheless. He was in and out of prison for fraud before dying when I was 17. His dad had also been in and out of prison since he was a child, so what hope did he have with a role model like that?<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/05/article-2125012-127BB5D5000005DC-572_306x395.jpg height=395 width=306 alt="Patsy Kensit with first husband Dan Donovan" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/05/article-2125012-127BB5B4000005DC-475_306x395.jpg height=395 width=306 alt="Patsy Kensit with second husband Jim Kerr" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Patsy with first husband, Big Audio Dynamite's Dan Donovan (left), and second husband, Simple Minds' Jim Kerr (right). 'My ex-husbands are still part of my life,' she said<br></p><h2><span>I grew up on movie sets, impoverished council estates and a convent.</span></h2><p><span>My childhood was spent between worlds. Dad had been a wealthy man, but then fell on hard times as he was a compulsive gambler. I didn’t feel like an outcast in any of the worlds, though;&nbsp; I adapted easily. I think we often worry too much about how kids are fitting in.</span></p><h2><span>I’ve always been a grafter.</span></h2><p><span>I’ve been acting since I was four. My parents always instilled a strong work ethic in me and despite his background, my dad taught me the importance of professionalism. I worked because I had to, and as my kids grew up I worried they hadn’t grasped the concept, but thankfully having seen me work so hard and support them irrespective of what was going on in my personal life, they’ve turned out to be level-headed young men. But it’s equally important to know your limitations. When I was lead singer of the band Eighth Wonder in the Eighties, I always knew I was an impostor and I wasn’t going to improve as a singer. But I was living every teenager’s dream at the time, so it was fun while it lasted. I’m not even any good at karaoke now.</span></p><h2 style=background-color:#fff><span>When Mum died, it was like having a vital organ removed.</span></h2><p><span>She was my best friend. I was four when she was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer in the Seventies. I was taken to the hospital several times to say my goodbyes, but she kept pulling through. It was an awful thing to have hanging over me. She was such a fighter and had never shown me how much pain she was in. Her illness drove me to work because I wanted to make money so I could look after her. When I was 18, I stopped Mum working and supported her. She defied the odds and lived another six years, dying not long after my son James’s first birthday.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/05/article-2125012-127858E6000005DC-502_306x395.jpg height=395 width=306 alt="Patsy Kensit with third husband, Liam Gallagher" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/04/05/article-2125012-127BB633000005DC-101_306x395.jpg height=395 width=306 alt="Patsy Kensit with fourth husband, Jeremy Healy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Patsy with her third husband, Liam Gallagher (left), and finally DJ Jeremy Healy (right). 'Liam and I get on fine now. James (her son with Jim Kerr) is even working for his clothing company,' she said<br></p><h2 style=color:#930><span>After four broken marriages I’ve pretty much decided that I don’t understand men.</span></h2><p><span>I’m a survivor and I feel like I’ve had enough passion to last me the rest of my life. I’ve learnt from all my experiences – I could either crumble or pick myself up, brush myself off and carry on. I’ve made mistakes, but I try not to regret them and rather learn from them. You could spend your whole life thinking, ‘Oh my God, why did I do that?’, but it’d be a waste because you can’t change the past. I could let things get the better of me, but what sort of example would I be setting for my kids? Life is never going to be perfect, as much as we want it to be, and I have to lead by example.</span></p><h2 style=color:#930><span>My ex-husbands are still part of my life.</span></h2><p><span>Jim’s mother was a wonderful grandmother and even after Liam and I split, his mum Peggy has always been there for Lennon and James, even though he’s her step-grandson. Liam and I get on fine now. James is even working for Liam’s clothing company, Pretty Green. I most want to be remembered for being as great a mother to James and Lennon as my mum was to me and my brother Jamie.</span></p><h2 style=color:#930><span>I hate jobsworths.</span></h2><p><span>Those sort of people seem to thrive on being difficult intentionally. Where I live, every morning a busload of parking attendants descends and they’re on the prowl for the slightest of infractions, which are questionable. They must be making a killing.</span></p><h2 style=color:#930><span>I have an obsessive compulsive disorder.</span></h2><p><span>I can’t bear to be surrounded by clutter and am constantly throwing away stuff, but sometimes I’m so efficient I throw away really important documents, which terrifies my PA.</span></p><h2 style=color:#930><span>There are better ways to age gracefully than sticking a needle full of poison in your face.</span></h2><p><span>I used to have Botox in my thirties, but to be honest you’re not going to work if you have a face that doesn’t move. I’m very happy to be growing old. I’m 43, I don’t smoke, I don’t drink much and I was in bed by 8.30pm last night.<br></span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span></span></p><span></span><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCforJwuc6so6KulWSus8DInKOeZWJmf3Z8kGtmiZmkqMZul8SnqqKsXXaztbHRZpmrp5uau265wKupopmXmsBuldWeZKmqlanBunnDnpqinJWZeop5w6ilrWWlo7GmvtKtmKecXaKyr3rHraSl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./uta-signs-comedian-franco-escamilla.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>UTA Signs Comedian Franco Escamilla</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./videopalmares-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Palmars Baln de Oro - MARCA.com</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
