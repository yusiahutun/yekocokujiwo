Sort of a blackout. I certainly didn’t expect it,” she said Monday morning by email. “I only realized they called my name when Tammy and Kelly Rundle (Fourth Wall Films) and Kevin Kelley and Marie Wilkes (New Mile Media Arts) reacted. I was able to have WQPT air their documentaries because they create great films telling important Midwestern stories.</p><p>“All of us at our table were nominated so we had a built-in cheering section for one another. I can only say it’s surreal,” Adams said. “Surreal in a good way, but surreal. Tammy Rundle has been freakishly insistent since we were nominated that I would win something.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/10/Emmy1.jpg><p>The Rundles were also nominated in the same documentary category for their “An Infantryman From Hero Street,” among five nominees total.</p><p>WQPT is proud to have been the station to air other local documentaries that have been nominated as well, a station release said Monday afternoon., Once WQPT has aired a film, the filmmaker then has the opportunity to place that film for Emmy consideration.</p><p>In addition to WQPT, this year Fourth Wall Films (four-time Emmy winners with two nominations this year) and New Mile Media Arts, also received Emmy nominations.</p><p>In addition to this year’s winning documentary, WQPT also received a nomination for their locally written and produced documentary Snapshots: Norma Jean, the Elephant, also written and produced by Lora Adams-Kopriva, with editing and writing by Chris Ryder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/10/Lora-Emmy.jpg><h2 class=inline-related-stories__heading>4 MORE</h2><ul class=inline-related-stories__list><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="WQPT announces new Emmy nominations">WQPT announces new Emmy nominations</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="QC producers earn five Emmy nominations">QC producers earn five Emmy nominations</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="World War 2 rail car brings history to life in Danville, Iowa">World War 2 rail car brings history to life</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="World War 2 rail car makes stop in Quad Cities on way to Danville Station Library & Museum">World War 2 rail car makes stop in Quad Cities</a></h3></li></ul><p>“I’m thrilled to see Lora and Chris recognized for their exceptional talent,” said Dawn Schmitt, WQPT’s general manager. “Congratulations to them for this well-deserved recognition of telling the stories of our region.”</p><p>Adams said she almost didn’t go to the Saturday night event because she was battling long-haul COVID, but her husband Michael asked as they were driving home, “Are you glad you went now?” &nbsp;</p><p>“I think I’m glad he talked me into going,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s important to acknowledge my editor/videographer, Chris Ryder,” Adams said. “He is who brought the story to my attention.

The Franks were transported by rail to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. Two months later, Anne and Margot were sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany.</p><p>15-year-old Anne died in Bergen-Belsen in February 1945, after contracting typhus, and that Margot also died there that month, around her 19th birthday. Their father Otto survived Auschwitz, but his wife Edith died in January, likely of starvation.</p><p>In 1988, the Wagner letters were sold for $165,000 to an anonymous buyer who donated them to the&nbsp;<a href=#>Simon Wiesenthal Center.</a>&nbsp;Reproductions are displayed at the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles.
