The former actress had nearly two decades’ worth of experience under her belt and is well-known for the American <a href=#>TV</a> law drama Suits. However, she stepped away from acting in 2017 to marry <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> a year later after meeting in 2016. Now, she has been supported by Talk TV’s JJ Ansiobi.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-187688785-593x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-s-return-to-acting-defended-by-broadcaster>Meghan Markle’s return to acting defended by broadcaster</h2><p>During a segment on Talk TV, the broadcaster <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">slammed fellow journalist</a> Tom Bower who called the couple’s rebrand a “failure.” The pair stepped away from being senior <a href=#>royals</a> in January 2020 to live “independently” of Harry’s family. Since then, they have had many deals with big corporations, including <a href=#>Netflix</a> with whom they produced projects such as the explosive docuseries Harry & Meghan.</p><p>Ansiobi told to his fellow hosts he believed Bower to “hate” Meghan. “I won’t call him a misogynist ’cause he’s not mean to all women, just Meghan Markle.”</p><p>He continued: “He knows clearly nothing about <a href=#>Hollywood</a> – stick to the royals Tom because you know nothing about how Hollywood works! Just because she’s signed to a new agency he thinks ‘Wow she should be working straight away.’ It’s not how it works.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Meghan Markle’s desire to return to acting will have ‘disastrous consequences for Harry’</a></p><p>He then compared her situation to the likes of <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese</a>, who he called the “best.”</p><p>“The biggest players in Hollywood do not work continually flat-out nonstop. Actually, the people that are less successful who are trudging and trawling trying to get everything they can.”</p><p>He then said DiCaprio and Scorsese struggled to get funding for their highly acclaimed 2013 <a href=#>movie</a> Wolf of Wall Street. He said of the <a href=#>celebrities</a>: “How have you got the world’s greatest director and the world’s greatest actor in Hollywood [and] no one wants to fund their films?</p><p>“That’s how Hollywood is.”</p><p>He concluded: “If he thinks they’re unsuccessful because they’re being paid a shed load of money from Netflix and Spotify. And Netflix have already it’s still the most successful documentary they’ve had on the platform, but they’re not successful?</p><p>“He’s an absolute Idiot who should get in the bin!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-tom-bower-say>What did Tom Bower say?</h2><p>Amid the rumors <a href=#>Meghan Markle might return to acting</a>, Bower said In an interview with Closer Magazine that Harry and Meghan had been “utterly unsuccessful” and “had failed.”</p><p>He told the publication: “They’ve got no new income streams, no new companies –everything they’ve attempted to do to relaunch themselves, I think, in the end, has been utterly unsuccessful and has failed.”</p><p>It comes after a psychic recently told Celebrity Tidbit <a href=#>he saw Meghan Markle return to acting</a>, and it’s not far away.</p><p>Adam Norton said: “I actually feel Meghan will return to work, so her career is about to take off in a different direction.</p><p>“I see some movie and acting work ahead for her, so definitely expect to see her on the big screen. Both behind and in front of the camera, so there’s some acting work she’ll be doing, but also a little bit of directing and behind-the-scenes action.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan will ‘last longer than asparagus’, TV personality says</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2Z%2FcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55knZ2WmrulscNmmJ%2Bslad6pcHCoZysq12WwbWxzKmrrGWkpHqjvsSaomahnqm8brTOpaOyr5%2BksW6ywKKjrGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./434172-60-heart-touching-birthday-wishes-boss-mentor.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>60+ heart touching birthday wishes for your boss or mentor</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./max-verstappen-girlfriend-kelly-piquet-28230601.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Max Verstappen's girlfriend Kelly Piquet poses nude in racy photoshoot</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
