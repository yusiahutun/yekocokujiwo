In 2021 alone, Rudd was crowned <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>PEOPLE's Sexiest Man Alive</a>, earned a spot in SNL's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>coveted Five-Timers Club</a> and joined yet another beloved franchise — he's already <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Ant-Man in the Marvel universe</a> — when he starred in Ghostbusters: Afterlife.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to Rudd's biggest supporters, one name stands out: Julie Yaeger, his wife of 20 years. The couple wed in 2003 and share two children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, who is Paul Rudd's other half? From meeting in a publicist's office to becoming unlikely business partners, here's everything to know about Julie Yaeger and her relationship with Rudd.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-a-producer-and-screenwriter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She's a producer and screenwriter</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Nicholas Hunt/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After getting her career start as a publicist in the 1990s, Yaeger has since switched roles and become a producer and screenwriter. In 2017, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Yaeger and Rudd collaborated</a> on the film Fun Mom Dinner, which premiered at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sundance Film Festival</a>. Yaeger wrote the screenplay, while her husband served as executive producer and made a cameo in the movie.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-met-rudd-in-his-publicists-office></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She met Rudd in his publicist's office</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Talk about the perfect meet-cute. Shortly after the success of Clueless, Rudd set himself up in New York to get a publicist. When he walked into the office, he was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>introduced to Yaeger</a>, who was working at the office at the time. He took her to lunch a few days later, and their romance blossomed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She was the first person I met in New York," he explained to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Marie Claire UK</a> in 2018. "We started talking and there was a maturity with her – she had experienced some tragedy in her life, I had too, and the impression I got was, wow, this is a woman. This isn't a girl."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-rudd-have-been-married-for-20-years></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Rudd have been married for 20 years</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Albert L.

Their son Jack Sullivan was born in 2006, followed by their daughter Darby in 2010.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, the family <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>posed for a sweet photo</a> when Rudd was presented with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. However, as the actor told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Marie Claire UK</a>, his and Yaeger's children are anything but impressed by their dad's fame.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Oh, I'm still the embarrassing dad," he said. "My daughter is eight and thinks I'm the bee's knees. My son is 13 and doesn't even want me going to his school. I make jokes to a series of eye rolls."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Feb. 6, 2023, Rudd confirmed that his kids <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>still aren't too impressed</a> with his work.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think I'm dad more than I'm Ant-Man or in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Yeah. They don't care, nor should they," he said during the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</a> premiere in Los Angeles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, Rudd spoke about Jack and Darby again when he revealed that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the kids only recently realized</a> that their dad is, in fact, an actor. "When my kids were very young — I'm not gonna sit my kids down when they're 3 and say, 'You know, I've got some DVDs to show you,' " he said in an interview with Willie Geist of Sunday TODAY. "I didn't really explain what I did."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He recalled when his son was "about 4 or 5 and went to a movie theater to see a movie with his friends."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were all going, and there was a movie poster that I was on that was in the lobby," the actor said.

After Rudd kept finding himself walking into a store called <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Samuel's Sweet Shop</a> in Rhinebeck, NY, he decided to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>purchase the store</a> after the previous owner died.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, he and Yaeger aren't the only celebrities involved — they co-own the shop with The Walking Dead star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jeffrey Dean Morgan</a> and his wife (and One Tree Hill alum) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Hilarie Burton</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rudd-says-hes-happiest-at-home-with-yaeger-and-their-children></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Rudd says he's happiest at home with Yaeger and their children</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite his high-profile career, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rudd told PEOPLE</a> in 2021 that the couple's home life is pretty low-key.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When I think about myself, I think of myself as a husband and a father, like I'm that," he shared.

That's what I kind of like the most."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in 2011, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rudd revealed to Elle</a> that he doesn't think his personal life is "going to sell a lot of tabloids."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My wife [Julie Yaeger, a former publicist] and I have been together for 16 years," he said.

In a 2012 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with the Los Angeles Times</a>, director Judd Apatow revealed that Yaeger and Judd's marriage — along with his own relationship with wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Leslie Mann</a> — inspired some of the scenes in This Is 40 and Knocked Up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rudd and Apatow would sit with their wives during rehearsal and ask them to share their biggest pet peeves about their partners to inspire the scenes and dialogue in the movies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We'll have the 'What is annoying you about each other?' conversation, and a lot of that makes its way into the movie," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an interview with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jewish Journal</a>, Rudd shared a specific quote from Yaeger that made it into Knocked Up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When Judd was writing that movie, my wife once said, 'I'm so sick of looking at your back,' because I was just on the computer all day, checking my fantasy football scores."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-is-rudds-biggest-supporter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She is Rudd's biggest supporter</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to Rudd's career, Yaeger is nothing but supportive of her husband's achievements. But when the actor was named <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PEOPLE's Sexiest Man Alive</a> in November 2021, Rudd said that his wife was momentarily "stupefied."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"But you know she was very sweet about it," he shared. "After some giggling and shock, she said 'Oh, they got it right.'
