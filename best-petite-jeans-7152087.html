Plus-size fashion blogger <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Victoria Voos</a> adds, “For those of us over a size 18, the jean options can be limited — then add in ‘<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>petite</a>’ and you’ve got even less to choose from!” The end result: you may feel like you’re constantly experimenting with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>jean styles</a>, feeling incredibly frustrated when they don’t fit your body in the right way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are a few things to know and look out for (more on that later). The most important question to answer right off the bat, though, is what makes petite jeans different: whether they’re smaller or just shorter than regular jeans. It depends on the brand and style, but good petite jeans don’t just have a higher inseam, necessarily — they may also have a shorter rise, higher knee placement, narrower waistbands, and a smaller crotch. “You can certainly have jeans hemmed, but it’s important to maintain the proportions of the jeans,” says style expert <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Naina Singla</a>, “so pockets should be placed in the right place, the rise might need to be adjusted, and so on.” Adds Stitch Fix stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Gillian McHattie</a>, “Simply hemming regular jeans isn’t always sufficient, as it may alter the intended silhouette and proportions of the garment.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To determine the most worthwhile petite jeans on the market, we chatted with Singla, McHattie, Voos, Universal Standard’s Chief Design Officer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ramon Martin</a>, and trend forecaster and fashion direction consultant <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kendall Becker</a>.

It’s also thoughtfully constructed with pockets that are higher and closer together for a better fit. The straight-leg style can fit a variety of body types, and there’s also a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">curvy version</a>. Singla notes that the jeans are also less expensive than a number of other petite jeans, calling them “very budget-friendly.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They come in a number of colors, which means if they fit well, you can buy a couple without breaking the bank. Also worth noting: these jeans are made of organic cotton and the first stretch yarn to not be made with harmful chemicals (one of the many ways Everlane practices sustainability), so they’re ethically made, too.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Organic cotton, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 7 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 26.5, 28.5 inches | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–35</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-old-navy-high-waisted-og-loose-jeans-for-women></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Old Navy High-Waisted OG Loose Jeans for Women</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Old Navy High-Waisted OG Loose Jeans for Women" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/J1yinUdyFL2pEeTEFMRpsdXhSRM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Old-Navy-High-Waisted-OG-Loose-Jeans-for-Women-368541e004654c76af5efdf12dbb3d25.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Old Navy</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There’s good value for money here without feeling like the fit suffers.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Sizing across Old Navy can be inconsistent, which might mean you have to buy a couple of sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re unfamiliar, Old Navy has really improved its denim offering, with people now turning to the brand for jeans that fit perfectly (without tailoring) right out of the box. The petite sizing goes from size 0 to 18, and — even though reviewers write that there can sometimes be inconsistency in sizing across styles — once you find one that works well, apparently you can rely that it'll fit the next time you need to buy it, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Old Navy regularly has sales and discounts, which means you can keep an eye on a style you like and make a purchase when it goes on sale. These mom jeans apparently look and feel fantastic, comparing well against more expensive styles. They come in petite, regular, and tall, and there are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">curvy options</a> for some of the most popular styles that go all the way up to size 30.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, recycled cotton, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> Not listed (Petite, Regular, Tall lengths) | <strong>Size:</strong> 0–18&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-redone-the-shortie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>RE/DONE The Shortie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="RE/DONE The Shortie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/q1kIPsfxXUJd9OLV6NUrrQpjJ6A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/redone-the-shortie-9ee291948dd94e2ba51d8b90bbb2f9e6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>RE/DONE</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>For quality, it’s hard to beat the brand's construction (and it’s made ethically!).</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s not a dedicated petite style, so you may need to tweak the fit with the help of a tailor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The aptly named “shortie” has a 25-inch inseam, meaning it’s shorter than most of Re/Done’s options. (The celebrity-loved brand doesn’t have a dedicated petite section, but they have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">“cropped” versions</a> of their most popular jeans that are designed to be better for those who need shorter inseams.) Re/Done’s denim is extremely well-made; if you’re unfamiliar, the label started by upcycling vintage Levi’s, and its non-upcycled materials are still designed to be low-impact and low-waste. So while these cropped jeans would be an investment, they’re designed as a thick, vintage-inspired, long-lasting style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What I love about the Shortie is its workwear-inspired design, with the front patches giving a cool and edgy vibe without making the denim feel bulky or uncomfortable. If blue feels like too much, opt for the subtler white.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Organic cotton | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 25 inches | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–32<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-universal-standard-seine-high-rise-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Universal Standard High Rise Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Universal Standard Seine High Rise Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vMv00z0g1mYPyGteMWzKOFN7sS8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/universal-standard-seine-high-rise-skinny-jeans-3e932113b9b640d288c108067cb76233.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Universal Standard</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>If you've struggled with the fit of other jeans, these could be a great option.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some of the styles are popular and sell out fast.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re unfamiliar with Universal Standard, the really really size-inclusive brand that goes from size 00–40, take a peek at their website. It offers a ton of customizable options in its clothes — with these jeans, for example, you can get a 27-inch, 30-inch, 32-inch, or a “petite” inseam in a variety of colors. The petite inseam is a mere 24 inches, according to Martin; he says they’re “a best-seller and touted for the invisible built-in stretch, premium fabrication, intentional cut, and unbeatable comfort.” Voos also loves them for its inclusive sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of my favorite features is “See It in Your Size,” which lets you eyeball the product on someone with roughly your dimensions. I am not a plus-size person, but I also love the clothes, so it might be a good choice for you regardless of your dimensions. Some of the most popular colors go fast, but you can go on the waitlist for when it comes back in stock.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 7 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 24, 27, 30, 32 inches | <strong>Size:</strong> 00–40</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-straight-leg-mother-the-lil-mid-rise-dazzler-ankle-fray></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Straight Leg</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>MOTHER The Lil' Mid Rise Dazzler Ankle Fray</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="MOTHER The Lil' Mid Rise Dazzler Ankle Fray" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fH_QoYzaabR4aLStvgGq9L53q9Q=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mother-the-lil-mid-rise-dazzler-ankle-fray-1f31952d05d244e6bb1da3a81b9cc9a1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>MOTHER</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The design is top-notch and designed to complement a variety of body shapes.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You're paying for the higher quality and exceptional fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Singla loves the Dazzler, which is the most popular mid-rise straight-leg style because it’s designed to “hit right at the ankle.” The brand’s aptly named “LIL’ MOTHER” collection has a number of construction changes to fit smaller bodies, and includes rise, inseam, and knee placement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This option is vintage-inspired, both in design and weight (meaning it’s heavier than some modern jeans, and more likely to last longer). The frayed hem gives it a nice modern touch, and the fit is close to the body without feeling oppressive. It’s also structured, so it won’t feel loose and baggy with each consecutive wear, and the price-per-wear will be lower. It’s expensive, in other words, but you’ll wear it so often that the value for money will be extremely high.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, modal, polyester, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 25.5 inches | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–34</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wide-leg-madewell-the-petite-perfect-vintage-wide-leg-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Wide Leg</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell The Petite Perfect Vintage Wide-Leg Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Petite Perfect Vintage Wide-Leg Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9-AdIRxfuIFi4hgnGNC-DuVRA_I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madewell-the-petite-perfect-vintage-wide-leg-jean-e02d2bd8209c4a4fb8ab9b9ede2fd14d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These are good value for money — and Madewell regularly has discounts.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You might need to buy more than one size to see which one looks better.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Madewell has a nice array of petite jeans and inclusive sizing to boot. Singla likes this wide-leg vintage style for its “great price point, lots of washes to choose from, and great reviews.” In their reviews, customers who are as short as 5 feet, 2 inches tall say these are the perfect length. And the fact that the jeans are somewhat tapered in the thighs and looser starting at the knee means that it gives the look of a wide-leg jean without the bulk of a style that’s truly wide (which, if you’re unfamiliar, can swallow up a shorter person’s frame and make you look unintentionally shorter).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">My Madewell jeans fit well, wash well, and hold their shape without feeling saggy.

Voos calls them a worthwhile splurge, and customers tend to love the brand for the comfortable body sculpting designs that (per the website) “feel like a second skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The inseam is on the longer side (30 inches), but it’s a pretty tailorable style. The flare is long and wide, so even if you take a couple of inches off, it’ll still look and feel like a flare. Make sure to ask that they preserve the original hem, though, which is thick and attractive. It also gives the denim a cool retro vibe. You can also keep the inseam longer and wear it with boots: A flared pant gives so much length to a shorter body that it’s a must-have style if you’re interested in making yourself look taller.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Organic cotton, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 30 inches | <strong>Size:</strong> 00–32 Plus</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bootcut-levis-middy-bootcut-womens-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bootcut</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Levi’s Middy Bootcut Women's Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Levi&amp;acirc;s Middy Bootcut Women's Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Gq3IhsiLz3GFqAO8oOODpQoakSk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/levis-middy-bootcut-womens-jeans-e487a29ffd754deeb5f227ac4386bbdb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Leviâs</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>If you want a less extreme but still shapely flare, this pair is perfect.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Depending on your body, you might need to go down one size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Levi’s ranked highly among people we surveyed who need shorter jeans — both the men’s style and the women’s style (which is a good reminder that you needn’t always stay in the women’s section to find good clothes!). These bootcut jeans, which come in a number of different washes, offer 27-, 29-, and 31-inch inseams for better customization. And the flare at the bottom is gentle; in case you’re curious about the difference, a bootcut is a gentler flare that offers enough room for a boot to fit underneath it (hence the name).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pay attention to the reviews; customers say this one runs large so you may need to play around with sizing.

(If you go to Frame and search for “Pixie,” you’ll find the shorter styles.) The style is designed for short people, but do know that the inseam is still longer (28 inches) and will probably require some tailoring if that’s longer than the inseam you want. But because the fit is so wide, it can stand to lose a few inches without compromising its shape.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This style is quite stretchy and fits true to size, but note that it fits small in the waist — so you may need to size up. Wider pants can (counterintuitively) make short people look shorter, so it’s better to keep the inseam longer on pants like these: Think close to or skimming the floor when you’re in bare feet. If you happen to like a long denim style, keep them long so that they “pool” (bunch up) at your feet — that actually will make your legs look longer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, modal, Elasterell-P, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 28 inches | <strong>Size:</strong> 23–34</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-high-rise-abercrombie--fitch-curve-love-ultra-high-rise-90s-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best High-Rise</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch Ultra High Rise 90s Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch Curve Love Ultra 90s High Rise Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qzt5hmYhCHHGfI_IQi7Dlsq7ydM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Abercrombie--Fitch-Curve-Love-Ultra-90s-High-Rise-Straight-Jeans-0e6926a06f334e0b86747b9b979b7e0f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can make them your own with a variety of colors and inseams.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Certain colors sell out incredibly fast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re not familiar with the new Abercrombie, prepare to be impressed: These jeans apparently fit great and come in five inseams, including an extra-short one (26.5 inches).

It’s more of an investment than some others on this list, but when you’re going with a non-petite style, you want to prioritize good materials like this. A nice extra benefit is that there’s some built-in stretch — another feature you want to look for since it will mold to your body without getting saggy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, Elasterell-P, spandex | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 28 inches | <strong>Size:</strong> 24–32</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cropped-betabrand-signature-mid-rise-denim></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cropped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Betabrand Signature Mid-Rise Denim</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Betabrand Signature Mid-Rise Denim" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ShRlMV9qWE151294saGCF8Uev3Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/betabrand-signature-mid-rise-denim-87512ba5b6104b9d88f0e8dc01e2bfaf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Betabrand</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They offer some of the shortest lengths on this list.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>As of this writing, not all the colors have the short petite inseam.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re unfamiliar with Betabrand, it started by making dressy yoga pants but has since expanded to pants.

The style is very ’90s, thanks to the cargo pockets on the side and visible pockets in front, but the tailored fit feels modern instead of dated (you can also fit a boot underneath the pants, as a plus). It’s also made partially with recycled fibers and has just a little bit of stretch for a more comfortable fit.

This has a straight leg fit but tapers out towards the bottom, and has a little built-in stretch for better comfort. The inseam is 27.25 inches (but may vary just a tiny bit, depending on which size you get). Remember that a slightly longer inseam is actually preferable for a wider style, so this could work beautifully even if it goes slightly beyond your ankle bone.

They’re also some of the least expensive jeans on this list, and they have to be one of the most comfortable pairs as well. The inseam of the pull-on style — meaning you don’t have to zip them up — is 26 inches (it also comes in regular and long styles, if that’s too short), and it has a relaxed straight leg to accommodate different body types. Generally, reviewers’ only quibble is that they don’t come in more colors, which is (to be honest) a good problem to have.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Cotton, polyester, elastane | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Inseam:</strong> 26 inches | <strong>Size:</strong> 14–32</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Inseam Length:</strong> Before you do anything, go to a tailor and get yourself measured, because once you know your inseam, this whole process gets easier. (When you go, ask for three measurements: your inseam to the floor, to your ankle, and for a cropped style.) To be honest, it opens up a whole new world of denim styles you may not have considered. “If you have longer legs and a shorter torso, you may not need to shop in the petite section for your jeans,” Voos says.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> If you want stretchier pants, you don’t want to buy a pair of jeans that are made out of 100 percent cotton (which will be stiffer and more rigid). Instead, look for something with a small percentage of spandex, and check the reviews to see if reviewers found the denim comfortable. Voos notes that, for plus-size people especially, "Check the denim you’re looking at has stretch. You may notice that your belly needs space to move when you stand vs. when you are sitting. Having a comfy and stretchy pair of jeans will make this so much more comfortable and fit your body better." It's important to know, though, that a cotton blend with some percentage of polyester in it may not last as long or hold its shape as well as denim that’s all cotton.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fit:</strong> As mentioned, a dedicated petite style will have special fit considerations; a non-petite-specific style may still work, but you have to try it out. Explains Martin, “A well-designed, true petite fit, like Universal Standard’s petite, has every point of measure customized on the jean for a shorter height, including the rise, the hip and butt curves, knee and calf points.”</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> The right denim shape will depend on the shape you want to create (do you want to add length? Balance out a part of your body? And so on). “Petite shoppers should consider denim with minimal embellishments or large pockets, as these can often overwhelm a smaller frame. I also recommend avoiding overly baggy styles, which can drown out your proportions,” says McHattie, adding, “Straight-leg cuts are great options for a petite frame since they streamline the silhouette and create an elongated look.” Voos explains that to add height (particularly for a plus-size person), skinny, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>high-waisted</a>, and flare styles are also particularly useful.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Details:</strong> This is the kind of thing that people overlook before they buy their pants but ends up being a dealbreaker once they try them on. Pay attention to things like whether it's a zip-up, button-up, or pull-on style; whether you like the color (a darker rinse can have a slimming effect, but lighter rinses look more “classic”); the location of the pockets and seams and whether they’ll dig into your body; and other design features that are important to you.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Capacity for Tailoring:</strong> Make sure that the pants won’t look strange if you get them altered — pants that have ripped knees that hit too low on your body, for example, or denim with tons of patches that would be difficult to crop. If you love the pants but know that they’re just a little too long on you, take the extra step to think about how they might look tailored.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the best length for petite jeans?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Really, the question is: what do you want your pants to do? Do you want the illusion of height? (In this case, your length should be longer.) Do you like a cropped style best? (Look for the shortest inseam!) Becker explains that her inseam changes depending on the context: “For a pair of slimmer or straight-leg jeans, you’ll want to grab a pair of denim that hits right above your ankle bone — I recommend pairing these with flats or sneakers for a daytime look. When I’m styling denim for nighttime, especially if it’s paired with a heel, I look for a longer inseam that grazes the floor when I pop on a pair of heels — this creates the illusion of a longer leg — and a wide or straight leg cut.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Your best length is dependent on a few factors that are unique to you. Are you long-waisted, short-waisted, or neither? (Is your torso longer or shorter than your legs, in other words?) I happen to be long-waisted (an extremely long torso, in my case), which means I like my pants to fall at my ankle bone or longer to make my short legs look longer.&nbsp;Additionally, you'll want to know your hip and waist measurements. “As body sizes increase, the proportions will vary greatly, and so will the fit from retailer to retailer. When in doubt, go with the larger size and become BFFs with a tailor," Voos says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are high-waisted jeans flattering to petite figures?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They absolutely can be! Again it really depends on proportions more than anything else. Do you have a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>short torso</a> that you want to make look longer? High-waisted jeans aren't the best option for you — opt for something mid- or low-rise instead. High-waisted jeans make your lower half look longer, so pairing a high-waisted pair of jeans with a longer inseam will give you the illusion of height, if that’s what you want.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Why can’t I just buy a pair of non-petite jeans?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can, if you want! But just note that they may not fit exactly right when they arrive, meaning they could need some tailoring. I happen to love buying non-petite jeans — but, I like my pants to “pool. (This is the “puddle jeans” effect, where the pants are so long that they bunch up at the bottom), so I have my tailor hem conservatively. It’s better to have the hem be just a tiny bit too long than too short. The point is, speak to someone who knows how tailoring works, and when in doubt, show them the pants you’re thinking of buying to get their expert opinion.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katherine J.
