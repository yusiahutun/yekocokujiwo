But now, this man’s an essential part of the team. He is responsible for everyone’s safety while they work in one of the most dangerous workplaces.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This “Jim Thurber Bio” explores his life.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Where Is Gold Rush’s Jim Thurber Now?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jim Thurber now is a part of the Discovery Channel’s new series </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hoffman Family Gold</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. It features Todd Hoffman’s yet another journey to find gold, alongside his father, son, and the rest of his crew including Jim, foreman Andy Spinks, and mechanic Randy Hubler.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In case you’re confused, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hoffman Family Gold</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> is not a franchise of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Todd left the show back in 2018, and so did Jim. At the time, Jim had appeared in over 110 episodes of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> ever since its inaugural season in 2011.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Jim last was also credited with a few episodes of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush: The Dirt</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2020 and 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This hardworking person, who wore his heart on his sleeve, brings invaluable skills to the table. As the camp safety officer, Jim always made sure that no one was working without safety equipment and kept an eye out for his co-workers in an active mine site, patrolled by grizzly bears.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, guess we’ll be seeing more of Jim’s vigilance as </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hoffman Family Gold</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> proceeds.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to Discovery, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gold Rush</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> fans have watched Todd Hoffman and his crew from the very beginning. They’ve seen him excavate mine after mine for a chance to strike it rich in gold for years. So now, after a four-year hiatus, the Hoffman Crew is back again digging gold around a rundown mine far off the grid 80 miles north of Nome, Alaska.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Trying to save this mine would definitely be a big gamble for the crew. But on the bright side, if they’re successful, Todd will secure the mining rights for the next decade and could build a family legacy.</span></p><h3><b>Jim Thurber Net Worth</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jim Thurber garnered a net worth of under $300 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Considering, he was one missed mortgage payment away from losing his home in 2011, Jim has come a long way. Seems like his decision to spend his retirement fund to get to Alaska in search of gold was worth it after all.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before joining the Hoffman Crew, Jim has had over thirty years of experience in construction as a sheet metal worker. Unfortunately, the recession circa 2010 destroyed his business, and he almost lost everything.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But things are different now. Reportedly, a safety manager in Alaska made around $80 thousand per annum. So, this what probably what Jim was paid as well.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When Jim wasn’t working, he loved to go fishing or ride his dirt bike. In fact, he grew up racing mini-bikes and motorcycles. “It feels good, you know just open it up and go through the gears, it’s fun,” he explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Because he was so into bikes during his teen, his </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Centennial High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> 1978 graduate yearbook described him as — “Most likely to die on a motorcycle.”</span></p><h3><b>Jim Thurber Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jim Thurber, full name: Allan James Thurber, was 65 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Hoffman Family Gold</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He was one of the oldest Hoffman crew members.</span></p><h3><b>Does Jim Thurber Have A Wife?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Yes, Jim Thurber has a beautiful wife of over 30 years named Cynthia Slauson Thurber. The two were married on April 19, 1991, and share two kids named Breanna and Nathan A Thurber.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Their daughter Breanna turned 27 on July 30, 2021, while Nathan turned 29 on October 27, 2021. They both attended </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Reynolds High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Talking a little more about Jim’s wife, Cynthia hails from Portland, Oregon. She is a&nbsp; </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Gresham High School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> 1975 graduate who later went to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Mt. Hood Community College</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Thurber husband-wife is also a philanthropist at heart. They often contributed to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>HomeWithHeros</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, a nonprofit organization serving veterans with the gift of the outdoors.</span></p><h3><b>Jim Thurber Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jim Thurber stands tall at a height above 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mentioning his distinct features, Jim has long face that perfectly complements his thick mustache. In fact, his mustache was declared the best mustache on television by a few of his fans.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>What’s more, Jim’s mustache has its FB page called </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Jim Thurber’s mustache</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> with over 4K followers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Some ever say that Jim looks a lot like Vincenzo Santorini, the animated character from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Atlantis: The Lost Empire</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><h3><b>Jim Thurber Family</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jim Thurber wasn’t very open about his family. But we do have a few names related to him — Anna Thurber, Jeremy Thurber, Pam Thurber, Scott Thurber, Dan Slauson (brother-in-law), and Kelly Friedrich (niece).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>When Is Jim Thurber Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Jim receives his birthday wishes on June 13.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Where Is Jim Thurber From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>He hails from Boring, Oregon.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But as of 2022, he resided in Portland, Oregon.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Is Jim Thurber On Instagram?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, we couldn’t find him on Instagram.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, he was on Facebook @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>jim.thurber.96</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> (private) and @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>hurbergoldrush</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> (public).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, here’s his Twitter @</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>goldrushjim</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmo6GdYsGpwdGbnKtlkp68brrErWSwp6KptW6txp5ksKGWmnqou8udZKuto516r7vWaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./olivia-rodrigo-elle-cover.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Olivia Rodrigo's ELLE Magazine Cover Look Features Latex Gloves</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./509556-13-liberal-cities-florida-democrats-live.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>13 most liberal cities in Florida for democrats to live</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
