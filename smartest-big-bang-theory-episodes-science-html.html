Sheldon explained the theory to her as a way to help her decide whether she should go on a date with Leonard, or cancel the date to preserve their friendship. Leonard had the same fear, but immediately understood Sheldon’s advice when he offered Schrödinger’s cat as food for thought.

The biggest challenge, they realize, isn’t going to be the weather or a location so remote they’re 18 hours — via dogsled — from medical assistance, but that they’re going to have to spend three months in very close quarters with Sheldon, who insists they follow all his rules, who’s wearing a whistle around his neck, and who wants them to call him “Sir.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvqpsjgr001x3h66cyr5jnks@published data-word-count=31><strong>Real Science: </strong>Sheldon was unsuccessful in finding magnetic monopoles (literally magnets that have just one pole), but he’s not alone: In the real world, the<a href=#> search to prove they exist continues</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjvqpvxzu005k3h66dy411jkx@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“The Gorilla Experiment,” Season 3</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvqpsjhu002l3h66ymwzrmtj@published data-word-count=4><strong>Airdate: </strong>December 7, 2009</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvqpsjgl001u3h66sfb87boj@published data-word-count=146><strong>TV Science: </strong>Penny decides she wants to be able to talk to Leonard about his work with subatomic particles, so she convinces Sheldon to give her a crash course in physics. “Crash” ultimately describes the result of Sheldon’s attempt to provide Penny with a primer, as he starts off explaining things like the origin of the word “physika” (“the science of natural things”), but then quickly spirals off into trying to make her understand the equation for Newton’s second law of motion. That makes her cry, and she finally asks that he focus on helping her understand specifically what Leonard does.

He begins using any substance he can think of, including food from his friends’ lunch plates, marbles, and plastic balls in a giant ball pit (in one of the series’ most beloved scenes and examples of clever prop humor), to represent electrons so he can solve the problem. Finally, he looks to his hero, Albert Einstein, for inspiration. Just as Einstein came up with special relativity when he worked in the Swiss patent office, Sheldon thinks working a job where he performs rote duties might free up his mind to see things he’s otherwise missing.

Quick-thinking Sheldon puts the can in the building elevator and presses the “close door button.” The milk can explodes, taking out the elevator (which has remained broken throughout the show’s 12 seasons), but saving everyone’s lives. “Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord,” Leonard tells Penny. “Or the police.

But after some Brussels sprouts give him a case of gas, he tumbles down the stairs while leaving the building to go jogging.

His fellow astronauts, including real-life veteran of two Space Shuttle missions Mike Massimino, are amused by Howard’s frightened reaction to the mission, referring to him as “Froot Loops” (his favorite breakfast) and teasing him about his bossy mother and new wife. His space cohorts bully him even further, drugging him and drawing on his face, then treating him with a sedative that turns an anxious Howard into a Howard who’s so relaxed that he takes his pants off and performs acrobatic moves. Aside from Howard’s awkward relationship with the other astronauts, his mission looks authentic; Massimino also served as a technical consultant for the storyline and the cool Soyuz sets.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvqpskj7002t3h66eho97ugd@published data-word-count=33><strong>Real Science: </strong>Massimino, who walked in space four times and is the first person to tweet from space, is now a Columbia University professor and teaches the course “Introduction to Human Space Flight.”</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjvqpz6x2007k3h66qqi18ing@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>“The Troll Manifestation,” Season 8</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvqpsl5n00303h66fsk6abm1@published data-word-count=4><strong>Airdate: </strong>Feb. 5, 2015</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjvqpskuo002v3h665xkbubhs@published data-word-count=149><strong>TV Science: </strong>When Leonard has an epiphany about superfluid vacuum theory, he asks Sheldon to confirm it’s a valid observation.

Sheldon, ticked off at Leonard, Howard, and Raj for going ahead with the bitcoin mining after he refused to participate because of potential tax issues, took the bitcoins off the computer and put them on a Batman flash drive keychain Leonard carries.
