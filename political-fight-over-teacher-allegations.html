My campaign has focused on the positive achievements of the last four years and on the issues facing Moline.”</p><p>According to the Illinois State Board of Elections website, the group that sent the flyers supports Acri’s campaign and donated $15,000 to Acri’s campaign committee on March 11.</p><p>As for the teacher at the center of this controversy, the Moline-Coal Valley School District says it got the results of a criminal investigation by Moline police and the district will soon wrap up its internal investigation.</p><p>Local 4 News inquired about the case on March 5, but Moline Police Chief Darren Gault responded Tuesday that “the police department and our Juvenile Investigation Division … were wrapping up this investigation.”</p><p>Gault released an email to Local 4 from the Assistant State’s Attorney Heidi Weller declining to pursue charges.</p><p>In it, Weller “questioned the judgment involved in communicating with students via Snapchat,” but said they would be “unable to meet our burden of proof ” that “a pornographic video was disseminated knowingly or intentionally to students via Snapchat,” “the fact that the video was immediately deleted tends to support [redacted’s] assertion that the video was sent out inadvertently” and “there does not appear to be any intent to groom individual students.”</p><p>Gault also shared some details of the investigation now that it has wrapped.</p><p>“The allegation was that an inappropriate video was shared to students on social media,” Gault wrote. “It has taken awhile due to the delay by a social media platform in returning records to the police department. We just got those back for review at the end of February. The Rock Island County State’s Attorney reviewed the facts of the case on March 1, 2021 and determined there were no applicable criminal charges. The case was turned back over to the Moline-Coal Valley School District on March 9, 2021 to conduct an internal investigation. There are a variety of laws that require a criminal investigation done by a police department and an employee investigation done by an employer to be separate and not interfere with each other. An error in crossing over those lines may violate someone’s rights. So these are conducted separately and the criminal case typically takes precedence.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfrry2voylppyZnGKyrbHCraCopl2dsqKw0K6Yq6yVp8BwvM6loK2hk5a5brLIoJ%2BtZZ%2BrsrN5056YnKCVp3qiuMuenpqsmaS7tHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sarah-wallace-sues-wabc-claiming-fired-telling-truth-murder-case-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sarah Wallace sues WABC claiming she was 'fired for telling the truth' about murder case</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./richard-keys-affair-lucie-rose-16977269.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Love rat and 'pathological liar' Richard Keys caught again with pretty blonde lawyer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
