Could we just not gush about the person while the other person can still hear it?" the <a href=#><strong>Real Time with Bill Maher</strong></a> host asked.</p><p>Stern, who married Berns in 1978, but separated in 2000, was not here for Maher's comments, suggesting that the comedian "shut his mouth."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7045be5d-1589-4450-b084-db2a50cf6f92 data-container-ref=toofab:article:25233352-ecce-436f-b553-46c8e3e5c01b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/15/5by4/2023/09/08/154c1431e6904bfc8b69007d8cf04420_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Howard Stern Says His Ongoing Fear of Covid is Causing Tension with Wife: 'I'm Neurotic'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"What a sexist thing to say! Like, what a convoluted, nutty thing to say," Stern shot back. "It's assuming that he knows something about my first marriage. That, of course, the man must be leaving the woman and the woman must be devastated and be sitting around pining away for her famous man."</p><p>Stern's relationship with Beth began that same year, after meeting the animal rights activist at a dinner party. The two tied the knot in 2008 and have been together ever since.</p><p>He continued, "He ought to shut his mouth! I mean, I don't think I come on the air every day and say, 'I love my wife.' But I thought it was a pretty positive message, to -- especially with my audience -- to say to guys: 'Instead of like ragging on our wives, how about talking about that we appreciate them and love them?'"</p><p>In addition to taking the matter to his radio show, Stern told listeners that he emailed Maher after the podcast remarks.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a887e32b-17f7-4af5-badb-5f8a803590a4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:25233352-ecce-436f-b553-46c8e3e5c01b data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/aa/5by4/2023/09/06/aa2ae3a502e94c00b3da375520b230fd_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bill Maher Says Writers Aren't 'Owed a Living,' Doesn't Know How Late-Night TV Has Survived</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I wrote in an email, I said, 'Why don't you give me a phone call? Why don't you tell me what you think about my life and my marriage since you're, you know...'
