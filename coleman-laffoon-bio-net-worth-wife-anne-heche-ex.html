The actress died a week after a tragic car accident where she was critically injured.</p><p><a href=#>Homer Laffoon</a>, the oldest of two sons of Anne who she shared with her ex Coleman, told PEOPLE, “My brother Atlas and I lost our Mom. After six days of almost unbelievable emotional swings, I am left with a deep, wordless sadness. Hopefully, my mom is free from pain and beginning to explore what I like to imagine as her eternal freedom.”</p><p>So, has Coleman Lafffon broken his silence on his ex-wife’s death? Who is he?</p><h3><strong>Meet Coleman Laffoon, Anne Heche Ex</strong></h3><p>Coleman Laffoon is the ex-husband of late actress Anne Heche. Back in the 90s, Anne was famously dating Ellen Degeneres. However, a rumor surfaced that Anne left Ellen for cameraman Coleman. They reportedly met each other while he worked on Ellen’s comedy tour. The pair then exchanged wedding vows on 1 September 2001.</p><p>During that period, Anne welcomed her first son Homer Laffoon with Coleman. However, the marriage ran into a lot of trouble. Their marriage lasted only five and a half years in February 2007. The couple divorced and had a long custody fight for their son Homer, whom they welcomed in 2002.</p><p>A judge determined that Anne must pay $275,000 to her ex-husband, as well as $3,700 in monthly child support payments for Homer’s care. Moreover, Anne also had to pay 75 percent of Homer’s private school tuition.</p><p>According to court filings, the couple agreed to split the cost of any “agreed upon extracurricular activities” for their son. There is little information on Homer’s current activities because Anne and Homer are quite discreet.</p><p>During their custody battle, Coley accused Anne of cursing and berating him in front of her son. He also accused her of not caring for her son when he visited the set, instead leaving him with aides, and of showering with her son and her then-new boyfriend, James Tupper, while wearing bathing suits.</p><p>In retribution, Anne&nbsp;claimed that Coley Laffoon would often watch pornography and gamble while caring for their baby. She&nbsp;referred to her ex as a “lazy a**” during an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman.</p><p>According to Anne, Homer graduated high school in the summer of 2020.</p><p>Back in a 2007 appearance with The View, Anne said that her son, then seven, traveled twice a month from his home in Los Angeles to Vancouver, where she was filming her program, Men in Trees. She told the hosts: “Homer flies a lot … twice a month to see me. It’s hard. You’ve to got to open up your heart as if he’s right in front of you.”</p><p>After Anne’s death, Coleman prepared a video that he posted on his socials. In the video, he said, “Hey, it’s Coley. In the wake of Anne’s passing, I just want to say a few things. One, I loved her and I miss her. And I’m always going to.”</p><p>He added that their son Homer is “grieving her […] but he’s surrounded by family.”</p><p>“He is strong and he is going to be OK. And for all those people checking in, thank you. It’s hard for me, it’s hard for our family, it’s hard for Homer but we got each other and we have a lot of support and we are going to be OK.”</p><p>Coleman also shared that he would like to believe that his ex-wife is now free of pain “enjoying her experience whatever is next in her journey.”</p><p>He concluded, “She came in hot and she had a lot to say and she was brave and fearless, loved really hard, and was never afraid to let us know what she thinks and what she believed in. It was all about love so goodbye, Anne. Love you, thank you for the good times, there were so many. And in the meantime, I got our son and he will be fine. Love you.”</p><h3><strong>Coleman Laffoon Wife Now</strong></h3><p>Coleman Laffoon is currently married to his wife Alexi Laffoon who was his assistant. They tied the knots on 24 May 2015.
