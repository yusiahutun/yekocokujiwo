In a poignant moment, the smiling child is asked what he would ask his future self. "Is Taco Bell still around?" he replies.</p><p>A message then appears on screen, after his answer, which reads, "Unfortunately Caleb passed away the day after we made this video. He will never get to meet his future self. None of us will and we are very sad because he would have been great. Please kiss your kids and tell them you love them every day. You never know what day will be their last."</p><p></p><p>Caleb's mom first announced her son's passing via an Instagram post on Friday. "Yesterday at 7:08 p.m. Caleb Logan Bratayley passed away of natural causes. This has come as a shock to all of us," the caption read. "Words cannot describe how much we will miss him. His incredibly funny, loving and wonderful spirit made us all fall in love with him as a YouTuber, friend, brother and son. We know you tune in to watch each day and eagerly anticipate new videos, but ask that you bear with us while we deal with this tragedy as a family," she wrote. "Please help us honor our baked potato," she added, referencing the family's nickname for the teen.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Maker Studios, the Disney-owned digital media company that represents the YouTube stars, also confirmed the sad news. "We are heartbroken at the tragic loss of Caleb from Bratayley, a beloved member of the Maker family," the company wrote via Instagram. "Our love, support, thoughts, and prayers are with the Bratayley family."</p><p>The Bratayleys (which is not thought to be the family's real last name) began their rise to fame in 2010, with their YouTube page amassing more than one billion views. Logan is survived by his sisters <strong>Annie</strong>, 10, <strong>Hayley</strong>, 7, his mom, Katie, and his dad, <strong>Billy</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZyar264zqCYp2Wfm3q6u9StrJudo2Kvs63TmrClnalis6K5yKWwZpyZmsBurdNmaGxlYmV%2BdoGQaWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./faith-hill-daughter-swimsuit-bombshell-high-cut-bikini-dreamy-getaway-tim-mcgraw.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Faith Hill's daughter is a swimsuit bombshell in high-cut bikini during dreamy getaway</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-aniston-s-heart-s-brush.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This $8 Brush From Amazon Is So Similar to Jennifer Aniston's $58 One</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
