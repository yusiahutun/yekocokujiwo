Born Michael Andrew Fox in Edmonton, Alberta, his family moved to Vancouver when Michael was 10 and that’s where he developed his desire to act.</p><p>At age 15, he auditioned for the role of a 10 year old in a series called Leo and Me (1978), and thanks to such attributes as his short stature and distinctive youthful voice, he secured the role.</p><p>He soon dropped out of high school against the advice of one of his teachers, who told him, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox, you’re not going to be cute forever</a>,” to which Fox responded, “Maybe just long enough, sr.” When he recounted this on a David Letterman show appearances, Fox added, “It turns out we were both right.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/GettyImages-583044648-e1705960052151.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael J. Fox</a> became enthralled with acting when he appeared on stage in The Shadow Box and, in response, at 18 moved to Los Angeles – where else? With stars in his light blue eyes, Fox got a few television roles, his first being Letters from Frank, a TV film for which he’s credited under the name Michael Fox.</p><p>He added the J when he registered with the Screen Actors Guild and discovered there was already a Michael Fox listed. “I realized I couldn’t register as Michael A. Fox because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I didn’t want teen magazines to use headlines such as ‘Michael, A Fox!</a>‘”</p><p>But just as fast as the roles and accolades came, they quickly diminished. And like most out-of-work actors, he survived on boxes of mac and cheese. Fox also sold half of a sectional couch to a neighbor and sold paperback books to a local bookstore for cash to buy groceries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-3189118-edited.jpg><p>Then his agent called to tell him about an upcoming sitcom, Family Ties, and the role of Alex P. Keaton. With little to no money at that time, Fox didn’t even have a phone, a necessary lifeline in Hollywood, so he negotiated the deal from a phone booth outside a Pioneer Chicken restaurant in Hollywood and told the network they would need to call him between four and five since he would only be home then.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>‘Family Ties’ Cast Then and Now — You Won’t Believe How Much They’ve Changed!</a></p><p>He waited for the call outside the phone booth and was fortunately there to answer it and secure the role that made him famous. He shot the film Teen Wolf during a five-week break from Family Ties, then went on to make Back To The Future, both of which were released in 1985 (BTTF came out first, boosting the box office of Teen Wolf).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/GettyImages-607395774-edited.jpg><p>It was during the filming of Doc Hollywood in 1991, that Fox noticed his finger twitching and that he was unable to control the movement. He then saw a doctor who gave him the grim <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease</a>. During production of TV’s Spin City Fox often hid his left hand in his pocket due to the disease.&nbsp;But has not stopped him.

Instead of using his new psychic powers to help others, he uses them to con people.</p><p>But when an evil spirit appears, Frank may be the only one who can stop this evil from killing the living and the dead.
