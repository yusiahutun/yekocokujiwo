Unfortunately, after 6 years of their marital relationship, the couple got divorced due to some personal conflict. The former husband and wife lived in Beverly Hills which Kaminski had purchased for <strong>$2.1 million</strong> after their wedding.</p><p>In fact, it was Janusz who filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences.

Since their divorce, both Hunter and Kaminski have moved on from their divorce.</p><h2>Hunter - Dating Gordon MacDonald since 2001</h2><p>After her divorce, she <a href=# rel=noopener>started dating</a> her new boyfriend <strong>Gordon MacDonald</strong> who is a British actor. Together they have twin children named <strong>Press MacDonald</strong> and <strong>Claude MacDonald</strong>. In 2021, Hunter and MacDonald are still dating each other and they seem to be very happy with each other.</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2021/08/27/a-family-picture-of-actress-holly-hunter-and-her-husband-gordon-macdonald-and-their-twin-son--1630073237.jpg width=450 height=386 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>A family picture of actress Holly Hunter and her husband Gordon MacDonald and their twin son. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Pinterest</strong></span><p>On the other hand, Hunter and her long-term boyfriend MacDonald never got married or engaged.
