I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state,” Trump said.

Willis claims that the relationship began in 2022, after Wade started working for her office. When the legal team of one of Trump’s co-defendants found out in January, they argued that Willis engaged in “self-dealing”, per The New York Times. Willis acknowledged the relationship the following month, but insisted that there was no conflict of interest.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The case drew further criticism after the revelation that Wade had no experience prosecuting criminal cases in Atlanta, Georgia. Before the case, he was an municipal judge “dealing with traffic tickets”, per The Washington Post. His private firm was paid US$650,000 over a two-year period. Wade’s job under Willis would normally go to civil servants, but in this case, Willis opted to hire Wade.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">His resignation</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/cc8f76c5-86e6-4060-9625-a0669b303082_323d6dc6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the relationship between Willis and Wade was made public, a judge ruled that Willis’ team could remain on the Trump case if Wade stepped aside. So Wade quit in March, writing in a statement: “I am offering my resignation in the interest of democracy, in dedication to the American public, and to move this case forward as quickly as possible,” per The Hill.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">5 of the richest US TV show hosts ever – net worths, ranked</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What is Nathan Wade’s legal background?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/823c0b9a-a9c3-4bc1-8d33-e517b17463d0_1126e908.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Per Forbes, Wade’s legal career includes criminal and personal injury cases. He worked for Cobb County as an associate municipal court judge and as a state court judge, per Wade & Campbell’s company site. According to Fox News, Wade also ran for a seat on the Cobb County Superior Court three times, losing each time.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Wade’s personal drama</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/4364aafd-9b15-4340-acf4-cb9d41890037_ac707f82.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nathan’s woes did not end only with the bombshell revelations at his former job – his previous relationship came under the spotlight too. In April, it was reported that his ex-wife Jocelyn Wade filed a motion last September to reopen their divorce case, which was granted. This forced Nathan to reveal his expenses, which showcased non-work-related expenses with Willis on his credit card, per Fox5.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jocelyn claims that Nathan told her to pay for some major medical expenses for herself, including a colonoscopy and endoscopy. He said that she would be reimbursed, according to reports. However, the court had actually ordered him to pay the healthcare provider directly instead.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Court documents also reveal that he allegedly stopped financially supporting his two adult children. At the same time, he appeared to be living a lavish life while dating Willis, with the two going on holidays to Napa Valley and the Bahamas. Per New York Post, Wade spent more than US$6,000 between October and November 2022 on travel alone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZp6mpJq%2Fta3Ip6SepqRkrrPAyJyjnmdjZ4J6fpZyZrCgn2K5pq3DZqerp6OasLbAzqtkn6eimLKledGeqqKfnmKxsLrApZtmrKKqurG%2FjJ6jnpuknryvecinq56qlpq%2FprrCnmScmaOaeq%2Bt06GYp2WnlrGmedaaqmaen6q7pXnBng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./prancer-star-recalls-lifelong-lessons-sam-elliott-cloris-leachman-they-taught-me-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Prancer' Star Recalls Lifelong Lessons From Sam Elliott and Cloris Leachman 'They Taught Me so</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michigan-fans-celebrate-national-championship-win-setting-couches-fire-carrying-trees-singing-mr-brightside-jim-harbaughs-players-chairs-stadium-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michigan fans celebrate National Championship win by burning couches, carrying trees and singing Mr</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
