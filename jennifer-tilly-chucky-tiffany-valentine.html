Though she started out as a human, she quickly joined her man in doll form -- and, like Chucky himself, has been hopping back and forth between bodies and plastic playmates in the 26 years since.</p><p>Currently on the series, Tilly is playing a version of herself, possessed by Valentine, who is a super-fan of the actress. Yeah, there's layers here. And while Tilly is on death row after being jailed for murders Valentine committed in her body, the actress -- in real life -- teases fans will likely see the doll again very soon.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4d/16by9/2024/04/08/4dcea525c7544b33b258d40401b57343_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>"People absolutely love that doll. And I think this season was a little sparse on Tiffany doll," Tilly told TooFab ahead of the show's return this week. "I think they like to see me, but they also like to see the doll. So, I think they're going to be happily surprised when the doll resurfaces."</p><p>"Not to give anything away, but I do think that the doll is never gonna to be down for long," she added. "I think there's always a place for the Tiffany doll in the Chucky franchise."</p><p>Tilly said she totally understands why fans are so obsessed with the diminutive version of the character, admitting "there's something very adorable" and "funny" when it comes to seeing her do some of the completely outrageous things she does on the series. "But Tiffany in Jennifer Tilly is also very much Tiffany, but maybe not as compact and cute," she added, saying "it's nice to have a balance" between the two forms on the series.</p><p>"But I do honestly, on the other hand, I really do like being on the set in the flesh. Love our Chucky family. Love playing Tiffany, the person in high heels and a push-up bra, you know, running around doing my own stuff. I mean, that's what I live for," she told TooFab. "It's obviously a lot more fun than standing in a little looping studio and going, 'Chucky. You said we weren't going to kill anymore.'"</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@jennifertilly</a> is serving time AND looks ðŸ’… Get an inside look at her glamorous jail cell before catching the return of <a href=#>#Chucky</a> April 10 on <a href=#>@USANetwork</a> and <a href=#>@SYFY</a>.\ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rJetEN1zCn</a></p>â€” SYFY (@SYFY) <a href=#>March 26, 2024</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@SYFY</a><p>Tilly believes show creator Don Mancini "is always going to have a blend of both" -- and, hopefully, for many years to come.</p><p>The fact Tilly has been playing this role for more than 25 years now is something that came as a surprise to her too, with the actress crediting her Bound costar Gina Gershon for talking her into joining a franchise. While she thought her time with the series was done after the first film -- in which she "dies horribly" after giving birth to "a really unattractive looking child," per Tilly -- Manicni kept calling her back for more.</p><p>"I was very unfamiliar with the Chucky movies and how Chucky always comes back to life. And here it is, four movies and three seasons and 26 years later, and I am still playing Tiffany," said Tilly, who has a blast stepping into the character's stilettos.</p><p>"What I love about Don, he's my very good friend, is that in his mind, Tiffany hasn't gotten any older. So, it's always a hot trick to try to look the same that I did 26 years ago. So, every year before the season starts, it's like I'm on the treadmill and saying no to the milkshakes," she explained. "But it's very flattering, too, because not a lot of people my age get to be a glamazon and wear the push-up bra and the high heels and run and do their own stunts and the glittery dresses and the tiaras."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Calling Tiffany "part beauty queen, part drag queen," Tilly also opened up about coming up with some of the character's outlandish looks. According to her, she works with Mancini and costume designer Catherine Ashton on her wardrobe, saying the three of them "get super, super creative" each season.</p><p>"Every year, I send two suitcases of my sparkiest, most Tiffany outfits, my Spanx, my push-up bras, my high heels, and then we create her wardrobe, her combination of things that Catherine designs things and has them made, and the things that I brought," she explained.</p><p>Tilly also referenced a look coming up later this season, as she walks down the Green Mile with a veil and long black train.</p><p>"I was a little worried when I read season three and saw she was in jail the whole time," added the actress. "But then Don goes, no, no, she's going to bribe the guards and they're going to bring your cute outfits. And I was like, great, because that's what's important. Cute outfits.</p><p>See Tilly, Tiffany and said "cute outfits" when Chucky returns for Part 2 of Season 3 on April 10.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:175af051-2cee-4299-a03c-db1acec9d18c data-container-ref=toofab:article:0a9c80d7-32aa-4a73-8bcf-5bac5ba2522e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ac/5by4/2021/11/09/acb255beffe848e5979a3e91e3b129f0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Everett Collection/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jennifer Tilly Teases Sex, Murder and Mayhem for Tiffany -- 23 Years After Bride of Chucky (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maXBfn7KvusifnKtlpJ65rcWMnJ%2Bum5uuerW1xZ%2BYp7Fdq66tsc2toKedXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-momoa-body-shaming-trolls-vacation-dad-bod-twitter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Momoa Fans Hit Back at Body-Shaming Trolls Over Vacation 'Dad Bod' Pics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hanes-sweatpants-amazon-cyber-monday-2022-6830456.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>These Editor-Approved Hanes Sweatpants Are $11 for Cyber Monday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
