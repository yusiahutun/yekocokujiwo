But as the <a href=#>music</a> star sang her song, Is it Over Now? from the vault tracks on her version of 1989, the colors changed to red and white.</p><p>These are the colors of the Kanas Chiefs, the American football team that Travis Kelce plays for. How sweet!</p><p>It comes after the <a href=#>celebrity</a> donned the same colors to support the athlete at the first game she attended back in September. The internet went wild when they saw her cheering him on from his private box.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Travis Kelce’s mom still regrets what she said about Taylor Swift</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bracelets-are-their-thing>Bracelets are their thing</h2><p>This isn’t the first time that the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> has been seen with the jewelry, which has become somewhat of a symbol for them.</p><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift wore an ’87’ bracelet</a> when she attended a Chiefs game on October 22 as subtle support for her celebrity boyfriend. The 87 beads on the accessory are surrounded on both sides by beads that feature pink love hearts.</p><p>Travis has previously said on the podcast that he shares with his brother, New Heights, that he tried to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number on it after one of her concerts. Back in the summer, the hopeful had watched her sing and hoped they could meet afterward.</p><p>He explained: “If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets and I had received a bunch of them, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift with my number on it.”</p><p>The 33-year-old said that he took it “personally” that she wouldn’t meet him after the show, though he did acknowledge that she tends not to talk after shows.</p><p>“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings,” he said.</p><p>We now know they managed to meet up somehow, with the star revealing how T<a href=#>ravis and Taylor were brought together</a> in a recent interview.
