and film opportunities, and said she has been busy auditioning during US pilot season.</span></p><p><span>But her grisly end on Teen Wolf came as a massive shock to fans, thanks to the cast and crew remaining tight-lipped about the development.<br></span></p><p><span>As a skilled archer and gymnast from a line of werewolf hunters, Allison was a favourite among loyal viewers for being 'much more
