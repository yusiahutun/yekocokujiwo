The fun element is really important to me.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2020, Lousy published Yook, meaning “meat” in Cantonese, a photographic collection of his body-painting work on 10 female models.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The female body inspires me, a straight man, as an aesthetically pleasing subject matter.

His “vulgar poetry” is often in the form of Chinese couplets, in which both lines usually rhyme and have corresponding or related meanings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His graffiti can be found in various corners around Hong Kong, and though his Instagram page has been set to private in recent years, it still counts more than 42,000 followers.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I was exposed to Japanese AV when I was 13 or 14 years old, and have been deeply drawn to it since thenMatsushimaon</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Those familiar with JAV (Japanese adult video) culture would perhaps know where his alias came from.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kaede Matsushima is a former Japanese adult film actress who debuted in 2002. Known as one of the most successful adult film stars, she was a household name in East Asia among sexually frustrated teenage boys who found sexual awakening through unmonitored internet access in the 2000s.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My first AV idol was Kaede Matsushima – I suppose it’s the same for many men [of my generation],” Matsushimaon admits. “I was exposed to Japanese AV when I was 13 or 14 years old, and have been deeply drawn to it since then. My work is inspired by everything JAV, from the positions and the moans to the set lighting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/20/0b6abd0f-f200-4cc3-b763-54084dbc2c7f_bdb7ae62.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Matsushimaon started marking his cheeky couplets in the streets of Hong Kong in 2018 and had his first solo exhibition, whose title translated as “losing virginity”, in 2021. The exhibition was aptly held on Kowloon’s Portland Street, one of the city’s most well-known red-light districts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite its nature, Matsushimaon’s work has no shortage of female fans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was surprised that there were more female than male visitors to the exhibition. Maybe my work can help women express certain things they’ve been wanting to say for a long time but couldn’t say out loud.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Matsushimaon also uses the human body as a canvas, often writing his Cantonese lines on nude women, before photographing the bodies, as Lousy does.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong journalist’s famous Jiang Zemin interview goes from memes to art</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Professor Sonia Wong Yuk-ying, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s gender studies programme, says such work raises the question of whether it involves the sexual objectification of women.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Objectification, Wong says, occurs when one’s body is “rendered and reduced” to a subject matter that must appear as physically attractive.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, she believes in letting the audience decide for themselves, and says that she would like to see more women in Hong Kong become bold enough to make public marks and erotic art themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/20/adb9a6cc-541e-4b05-90ed-0bebd2dc14c5_322d4afa.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/10/20/60d2d0dc-52a1-447e-a433-f9e2d640f2cb_3c879e25.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She adds that when we think about art of a more erotic or explicit nature, we traditionally don’t imagine the audience as being female. This makes it harder for women to envision themselves in the roles of creators, instead only seeing themselves as muses or models, pandering to the stereotype of women adopting a more passive role.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s undeniable that there’s not a lot of space in such artistic disciplines for women to express their sexuality, especially in Hong Kong – the fact that we can’t think of many equivalents or examples right now says a lot on the matter.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Matsushimaon openly describes his art as “vulgar”, “intimate” and “sexual”, Lousy, however, asks: “What do you define as vulgar? I think it depends on how you see and measure it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Artists can’t always control their narratives. Maybe some of what I do can be defined as erotic art, but it’s nowhere near pornographic yet. The more conservative few may not get it, but I didn’t do it for them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR%2BknFtbG9frry2usZmpZqjlZl6uLvMnqVmmaKaerW0xKKpZpuRo8Oiv4ynrJ2dXZa%2FtXmRZpinp56uurDB0mafqKaXYriwusZmmKusmajBtHnCoZilpJWjtKa%2FjJygrbGj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./air-fryer-jalapeno-poppers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Air Fryer Jalapeo Poppers: Quick and Easy Recipe</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./smartest-big-bang-theory-episodes-science-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 18 Smartest Big Bang Theory Episodes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
