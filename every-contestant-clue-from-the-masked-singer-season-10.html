When I was just a teenager, I took a huge chance and performed in a national talent competition, but I crashed and burned. It was super bad, and it made me almost swear off singing for good — but music was always my first love.”&nbsp;</p><p>For her onstage clue, the men in black brought out a vinyl record that read “movie soundtrack.” Gazelle hinted, “Not only do I act in movies, I also sing in them.”</p><p>Her visual clues included a Hawaiian shirt, bulldogs and a poster reading, “Hello Doll!”&nbsp;</p><p>During the October 4 episode, Gazelle said she was pressured to change her name at 8 years old so she would appeal to a wider audience, but she decided not to because she was proud of her heritage and wanted to blaze a trail for little girls who look like her. Her clue package also included a surfboard, a test with the grade “A” on it and a sign reading, “Threat Level 3.” On stage, the panel saw a football decorated with the word “villain,” which Gazelle explained by saying, “I’m not actually a villain, but I can play the part.”</p><p>One week later, she said she made her film debut in the 2000s. She chose Gazelle as her costume, she explained, because gazelles are similar to deer, and a person close to her who loved deer died shortly before her wedding. Her visual clues included a bouquet of flowers, a mouse and a dog tag.&nbsp;</p><p>During the November 29 episode, Gazelle said she was a “truly hammy, performative kid,” and her parents “uprooted” their lives so she could follow her dreams. Her visual clues were a magnifying glass and a manuscript labeled with the word “mystery.” On stage, she told Scherzinger that they are similar because they both hold “the island” close to their hearts.&nbsp;</p><p>Gazelle revealed during the December 20 finale that the Gazelle costume was extra meaningful to her because she has a deer tattoo with flowers coming out of the antlers as a tribute to a loved one who died.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Identity:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Janel Parrish</strong></a>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Baw6a%2B2GaaqKakmsC1rc2tZJykpZp6p77OpmStoJViuqK%2Fyp6bZquZo7SmvoysnJqrn6N6cnyO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cody-johnson-jelly-roll-carrie-underwood-st-jude-this-shirt-saves-lives-t-shirt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jelly Roll, Carrie Underwood + More Hope You'll Support St. Jude</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./18-early-fourth-of-july-clothing-fashion-sales-to-shop-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>18 Early Fourth of July Clothing &amp;amp; Fashion Sales To Shop Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
