Revenge makes them suffer more than they made you.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Take revenge rather than punish and you set off a nasty chain reaction: they strike back, you strike again and before you know it you’re arch enemies rather than two people trying to repair a damaged relationship.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The previous study (2011) also came to the conclusion that couples should choose their battles.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Their research concluded that it’s best to forgive minor offences and hold your partner accountable for serious or repeat offences.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium mol-style-bold femail-ccox">So what is the best, most effective punishment?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Forget satisfying solutions like cutting one arm off each of his suits or scratching her beloved car.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A good talking to is what works best, according to Professor Strelan’s research.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Most people feel guilty when they’ve done something wrong.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Which is why being told how much you’ve hurt and disappointed someone you love dearly – and seeing how it’s affected them - is the most effective way to stop them doing it again.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The couples in Stelan’s study said once they’d told their partner why they were hurt and saw how guilty their partner was hearing about it, forgiveness was much easier.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And if talking doesn’t do it, the silent treatment just might.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If you’re a couple who are good at talking through differences, refusing to discuss it until you feel ready will absolutely let your partner know they really have stepped out of line.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium mol-style-bold femail-ccox">Once you’ve punished, there are only two ways forward.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The first is to choose not to forgive but agree to stop talking about it – continually harping on about something they did just destroys the relationship over time.
