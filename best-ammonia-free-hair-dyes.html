A common ingredient found in many hair dyes, ammonia is an active that makes strands more susceptible to color saturation. More specifically, celebrity hairstylist Michelle Cleveland says, “Ammonia raises the pH level of the hair during the oxidation process which in turn opens the cuticles of the hair, and allows the color to be deposited deep into the cortex of the hair.” In short: Ammonia has long been the key to, well, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>long-lasting color</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Considering the strong scent and often irritating nature of the ingredient, though, scientists have set out to find ingredients, such as ethanolamine, monoethanolamine (MEA), and sodium carbonate, that mimic ammonia without the aroma. Because of this, ammonia-free hair dyes are rising in popularity, with many brands hopping onto the bandwagon. While it’s great to have variety, a highly-saturated market means that it can be difficult to know which dyes are actually worthwhile. To help clear up any confusion, we researched the highest-rated formulas and chatted with celebrity stylists for their top picks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, uncover the best ammonia-free hair dyes that provide rich, vibrant color.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-revlon-colorsilk-beautiful-color-permanent-hair-color></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Revlon Colorsilk Permanent Hair Color</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revlon Colorsilk Beautiful Color Permanent Hair Color" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/0AJV7Kvrg6kUg1VtjbqmrqAskMo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/revlon-colorsilk-beautiful-color-permanent-hair-color-27fc257eba6a446c85dea0af2814530b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s sold in over 40 shades and it’s keratin-enriched, so it helps strengthen hair.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Using this can sometimes create a tingling sensation on the scalp.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Revlon Colorsilk Beautiful Color Permanent Hair Color has wowed DIY dyers across the world with its ammonia-free, keratin-enriched formula that’s sold in over 40 shades ranging from ultra light blonde and chestnut brown, to auburn and jet black.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At-home users aren’t the only fans, though. Celebrity colorist Sharon Dorram, who owns <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Sharon Dorram Color at Sally Hershberger</a> in New York City, also applauds the formula. “It touts keratin and silk amino acids [which reinforces hairs' strength], has a very good color range, and imparts beautiful shine,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each box contains a bottle of the ammonia-free colorant, a bottle of the cream developer, and an ultra-hydrating cream conditioner to deeply nourish your hair after processing. The no drip-bottle design ensures a mess-free application, too. Simply part hair into four sections, apply the color, and let it sit for 25 to 35 minutes before rinsing out. It’s worth noting that some users report that the dye makes their scalp tingly, but those instances are few and far between (and a very minor inconvenience for vibrant, long-lasting color).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Isopropyl alcohol, oleic acid, ethanolamine |<strong> Type: </strong>Permanent<strong> </strong>| <strong>Shades: </strong>41 | <strong>Size: </strong>4.4 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-clairol-natural-instincts-demi-permanent-hair-color></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Clairol Natural Instincts Hair Color</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Clairol Natural Instincts Demi-Permanent Hair Color" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/doNvzfUC_4KeSx9Km_3dXqY-DxI=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ClairolNaturalInstinctsDemi-PermanentHairColor-9a00e69272844c64850dbbff8ec6ea47.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s made with 80 percent naturally-derived ingredients.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This isn't strong enough to fully cover gray hairs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to being quite affordable, Clairol Natural Instincts Demi-Permanent Hair Dye is one of (if not the) cleanest at-home hair dye options on the market. Formulated with 80 percent natural ingredients,&nbsp;it’s a deeply nourishing coloring agent that’s designed to leave hair looking healthy and bright. Dorram is also fond of this formula, thanks to the inclusion of coconut and aloe vera, which helps to deep-condition hair during the dye process.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in 38 hues (including three red options), this ammonia-free dye will keep hair vibrant through 28 washes — this impressive longevity means you can extend the time between dye jobs, and ultimately save money in the long run. But if you're looking to cover stubborn gray hairs, you may want to go with something else because this formula isn't strong enough to fully cover them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Propylene glycol, hydrogen peroxide, cetearyl alcohol |<strong> Type: </strong>Demi-permanent<strong> </strong>| <strong>Shades: </strong>38 | <strong>Size: </strong>10.4 oz.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-madison-reed-radiant-hair-color-kit></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madison Reed Radiant Hair Color Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madison Reed Radiant Hair Color Kit" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eIvkm6yAmQBNMEFXmsn2Uw3F5DY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madison-reed-radiant-hair-color-kit-03da6caa04014139bbceab1d9fc5f7d7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It promises 100 percent gray coverage and features a no-mess system.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some colors turn out darker than they appear on the box.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your goal is to recreate a salon-like dye experience at home, the Madison Reed Radiant Hair Color Kit is a great option. “This permanent hair color is free of ammonia, parabens, and resorcinol, and includes nourishing keratin, argan oil, and ginseng root extract to help condition and strengthen the hair,” says New Jersey-based color specialist Jennifer Korab. “It's also available in many shades and provides multidimensional, long-lasting color.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The well thought-out kit includes everything you need for seamless coloring at home: On top of the cream color and the conditioning color activator, you’ll also find a set of gloves, a cap, cleansing wipes, and Madison Reed’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>color protecting shampoo</a> and conditioner. And, the application process is pretty enjoyable because the ammonia-free dye doesn’t have a harsh, pungent smell.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love almost everything about this kit, but we noticed that some of the colors turn out a bit darker than they do on the box (especially in the brown and red ranges). Because of this, we recommend opting for one shade lighter than the color you’re going for to get the closest match.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Stearyl alcohol, propylene glycol, ethanolamine |<strong> Type: </strong>Permanent<strong> </strong>| <strong>Shades: </strong>36 | <strong>Size: </strong>1.7 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-garnier-olia-oil-permanent-hair-color></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Garnier Olia Oil Permanent Hair Color</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Garnier Olia Oil Permanent Hair Color" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/oh8yPrF2bPO-OiRAO6bg15bsorU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/garnier-olia-oil-permanent-hair-color-98b6c796486a4376b66105f7ce5e1407.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s infused with 60 percent oils, so it’s super hydrating and nourishing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It can sometimes leave hair feeling extra greasy — even after rinse-out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hoping to really pump up the shine factor while enhancing your color at home? Korab suggests reaching for the Garnier Olia Oil-Powered Permanent Color — a drugstore dye beloved by over 10,000 Amazon shoppers. “It’s infused with natural flower oils and is made without ammonia, parabens, and silicones,” she says, applauding the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shine-enhancing formula</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because of the oil-enhanced formula, this dye can also make hair look a bit greasy, though, especially if your hair leans oily.

The same nourishing ingredients make the consistency of the dye very thick (like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>deep-conditioning hair mask</a>). This makes it a bit difficult to apply — we recommend wetting your hair during the dye process so it spreads a bit easier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Cetearyl alcohol, palm oil, behentrimonium chloride |<strong> Type: </strong>Permanent<strong> </strong>| <strong>Shades: </strong>18 | <strong>Size: </strong>7.05 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-gray-hair-naturtint-permanent-hair-color></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Gray Hair</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Naturtint Hair Dye</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="hair dye" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lSXDJNiJ79bu-fuRjKHWUc8a77M=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Naturtint-Hair-Color-b32ac5c7d0f143faa08cd31795ddb328.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Naturtint</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s made with 92 percent naturally-derived ingredients and promises long-lasting gray coverage.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It can sometimes leave a slimy film behind during rinse-out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gray hair is notoriously difficult to cover up. And while we’re all for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>embracing our grays</a>, we understand if you feel more confident with a quick coloring. If you want to cover your grays at home with an ammonia-free dye, Naturtint Permanent Hair Color is the thing to grab.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The gel formula is designed to impart beautiful color and notable shine. “It includes natural ingredients such as oat, soy, and coconut oil to help nourish and protect the hair,” Korab adds, noting that the color payoff — which offers long-lasting gray coverage — is remarkable. The payoff is so impressive that it can take a while to fully rinse out the dye post-processing, and while rinsing, hair can feel rather slimy. Don’t get discouraged: An extra lather of shampoo for gray hair will leave your hair feeling soft and fresh.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Alcohol, propylene glycol, ethanolamine |<strong> Type: </strong>Permanent<strong> </strong>| <strong>Shades: </strong>35 | <strong>Size: </strong>5.75 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-kit-hally-color-cloud-atomic-blonde></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Kit</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hally Color Cloud Atomic Blonde</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hally Color Cloud Atomic Blonde" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jogf2bvNgmrcBvmdgmzJBVgCdsc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hally-color-cloud-atomic-blonde-2820cb867111447b93a6b103888e791f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Hally</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes with a fully-stocked kit, including hair clips and under-eye masks to help you relax during the process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There’s not a large color range to choose from, and most of them are bright colors like pink or blue.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Coloring hair at home can be confusing — especially if it’s your first time. But having a handy kit with everything you’ll need to have a seamless process makes it a bit easier. We love Hally’s Color Cloud Kit because beyond including the dye, developer, hair clips, and gloves, it also features some quirky additions, like stress putty and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>under-eye masks</a> to make the dying process more relaxing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a demi-permanent formula, this dye washes out after four to six weeks, making it ideal for beginners who just want to test out a new color. Though, keep in mind that there aren’t many hues to choose from.

Because of this, it’s helpful to look for strengthening formulas to help build your strands back up. According to both Dorram and Korab, the Schwarzkopf Simply Color Permanent Color is a fantastic option. “It includes a nourishing oat milk and soy protein [blend] to help protect and strengthen the hair,” Korab explains. With 18 shades to choose from, this healthy hair dye also completely covers grays for a vibrant, youthful finish.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One note: While it’s marketed as a permanent color, we found that this doesn’t last as long as other options on this list.

While the ingredient is thought to be a better alternative to ammonia thanks to its lack of a pungent odor, some people still find it to be irritating. Since it’s much less concentrated in this formula, though, it’s been shown to be tolerable across the board.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond protecting the scalp, this dye also offers gorgeous, vibrant color payoff in 38 shades. Plus, with the addition of eight herbal extracts, it acts as a natural toner to ward off brassiness and soothes the scalp. If you’re trying to cover grays, though, you may want to look elsewhere because this isn’t as effective on that growth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Hydrogen peroxide, etidronic acid, trideceth-9 |<strong> Type: </strong>Permanent<strong> </strong>| <strong>Shades: </strong>38 | <strong>Size: </strong>4.56 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-color-depositing-conditioner-dphue-gloss-semi-permanent-hair-color-and-deep-conditioner></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Color-Depositing Conditioner</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>dpHue Gloss+</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="dpHue Gloss+ Semi-Permanent Hair Color and Deep Conditioner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AkcS5exHFrRyvAPhwSwAFPT-3-8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dphue-gloss--e35f5b8d451a468995c039b8bc333769.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a color-depositing conditioner, so it can be used as often as you’d like.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The Copper and Strawberry hues can stain skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not one for mixing dyes or waiting around for your hair color to process?

Additionally, she points out that both semi- and demi-permanent dyes only deposit color. “Meaning they will only make hair darker,” she says. “Typically, they will only cover gray hair up to 70 percent.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are ammonia-free hair dyes better for hair?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They can be. “Ammonia-free hair dyes can be better for you if you have a sensitive scalp, skin, or eyes,” Doram says.
