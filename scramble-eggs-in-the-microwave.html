After finding myself in the same situation time and time again, I am advocating for whipping up some scrambled eggs in the microwave — yes, eggs in the microwave.&nbsp;</p><p>But first, some transparency: Eggs cooked in a microwave are never going to taste exactly the same as eggs scrambled in a pan. As helpful as microwaves are for heating and reheating, they just can’t replicate the same crispy goodness as your stovetop. But once you make peace with that, you can truly enjoy the time you’ll save with this hack. The best part? You don’t have to sacrifice flavor.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">BBC</a>, basic scrambled eggs in the microwave typically call for just three ingredients: butter or oil to grease your microwave-safe bowl or cup, two eggs, and an optional tablespoon of milk. While many folks like to put milk in their scrambled eggs, thanks to <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">Alton Brown</a>, I’ve become a staunch believer in adding mayo instead. So it made perfect sense for me to sub one tablespoon of mayo in place of milk for my microwaved eggs as well.&nbsp;</p><p>I started off by greasing my microwave-safe bowl with olive oil. Tip: Be sure to swish your oil (or butter) around generously so your eggs don’t stick to the dish. Next, I cracked two eggs into the bowl, added a tablespoon of mayo, and got to seasoning. I added a generous amount of salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to the bowl to ensure my eggs would have a noticeable, yet simple flavor. Then, I whisked the mixture quickly with a fork and put it in the microwave.</p><p>BBC recommends microwaving your eggs in 30-second intervals. After the first interval, my eggs were still watery, but I noticed a few sections had started to solidify. So I grabbed my whisking fork and swirled it around a few times before putting my bowl back in for another 30 seconds. (I guess you could call my whisking the “scrambling” part.) The second time around, my bowl was steaming. I took a peak inside and figured the eggs were probably done, but could use about 15 more seconds. I gave the bowl another quick “scramble” with the fork, taking care to scrape off any small pieces clinging to the dish. Then, I put it in the microwave for 15 more seconds. And voilà — my eggs were ready to enjoy!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/how-to-scramble-eggs-in-the-microwave.jpg><p>I’ve always been a big believer in seasoning my eggs generously, even when using simple spices like salt and pepper. But this time, my instincts told me I needed even more seasoning than I usually use for pan-cooked eggs. So I added more salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes on top. Finally, it was time to dig in — with a fresh fork, of course.</p><p>My instincts were correct: The generous seasoning brought flavor to what might have been a pretty bland-tasting dish. And the mayo brought a level of creaminess to the meal that I’m still convinced milk can’t do.</p><p>Make no mistake: I could not trick myself into thinking microwaved eggs were exactly the same as ones I cooked on a pan. But you know what? They still tasted pretty darn good. Even better? They kept me full and functioning for hours. Added bonus: Cleanup is always so much easier without a dirty pan. What more could you ask from a quick breakfast on a crazy busy day?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonainlGK%2Fpq%2FIqZysZ6OYv6K5waWcZp2XnMButc1mq6GdXaK2pL7OsJivnQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./weekend-benessere-primavera-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I break primaverili del 2024 sono all'insegna del benessere</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./netflix-reality-shows.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Netflix: Who is Nao Yamatomo?
