Amirah's parents were separated then, but Mansoor had primary custody of the little girl.</p><p class=align-left>The court had also granted Tynesha, her mother, the right to occasionally spend time with Amirah. However, after Tynesha abused visitation rights by abducting her daughter for a month, the judge ruled against the right to visit her daughter again.</p><h2>What happened after Tynesha took Amirah Watson?</h2><p class=align-left>Before her disappearance, Amirah was last seen on January 31, 2020, in Dillon County, South Carolina, where her father was handing her over to Tynesha.

Unfortunately, it was not successful, and that's when the police issued an arrest warrant against Brooks for kidnapping.</p><h2>Did they find Tynesha?</h2><p class=align-left>The search continued with the police calling Tynesha's sister, Jackie McKee, who told them that Tynesha might have gone to a relative's Atlanta house.</p><p class=align-left>Jackie also defended her sister for escaping with her daughter, alleging that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mansoor physically abused Tynesha</a> before the separation.
