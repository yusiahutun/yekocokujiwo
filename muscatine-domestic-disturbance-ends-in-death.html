It was alleged that the male had been armed with a handgun during the incident and had made threats towards the female.</p><p>As the investigation developed, investigators ended up going to the man’s residence, 409 W. 5th St., in an attempt to make contact with him. At approximately 9:28 p.m., as Investigators were knocking at the front door of the residence, a single gunshot was heard coming from inside the residence. Investigators immediately retreated to safety when a second gunshot was heard.</p><p>As assisting officers arrived, the area was shut down to traffic and remained shut down for the next couple of hours. Repeated attempts were made to establish communications with the man over a loudspeaker, but officers got no response. At 10:52 p.m., the decision was made to breach the front door of the residence and the man in question was found deceased inside from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.</p><p>He has been identified as Terry Snyder, age 65. Investigation into this incident is ongoing, police said.</p><p>The Muscatine Police Department was assisted by members of the Muscatine County Sheriff’s Office, the Muscatine Fire Department, and members of MSORT, (the areas multi-jurisdictional special operations team). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKSuq5OWwaq6xGabqKWVqMGqr4ydoKyspaevorrCnmSeppSoeqq6jJ2cmqyYZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./met-spanish-language-opera.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Quest Is Love</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kris-jenner-home-photo-study-with-family-photos-famous-children.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kris Jenner invites fans inside study at LA home complete with family photos of her famous child</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
