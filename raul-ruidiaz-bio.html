Triunfo, Peru.</p><p>Like most other South American kids, Raul dreamed of becoming a professional soccer player at a very young age.</p><p>Therefore, to realize his dreams, Ruidiaz joined the youth academy of Universitario de Deportes at the tender age of 8.</p><p>After that, the Lima native rose through the ranks of Deportes until he got promoted to the first team in January 2008.</p><p>Soon after, the Sounders striker was loaned to the club’s B team America Cochahuayco with whom he showed his flashes of brilliance.</p><p>Consequently, the following season, Raul got the opportunity to play for the first Universitario de Deportes.</p><p>At this club, the young player would make a name for himself in soccer.</p><p><strong>Read Here <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diego Rossi Bio: Career, Stats, Salary, Transfers, Wife Wiki >></a></strong></p><h2>Raul Ruidiaz | Career & Stats</h2><p>Ruidiaz made his professional debut for Deportes against Total Chalaco on 4 October 2009 at 19.</p><p>After that, the Lima native mesmerized everybody, scoring three goals in nine games.</p><p>Additionally, Raul won his first national title in his first professional season, making his debut even better.</p><p>Everyone expected a young Ruidiaz to take his game to the next level as he had the ability and determination to become one of the greats.</p><p>Staying true to everyone’s expectations, Ruidiaz scored seven goals and provided four assists in his 37 appearances for the club in his second season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/raul-1.jpg><p>Consequently, many top clubs in Chile and South America wanted the services of the young prodigy.</p><p>However, he decided to stay with his boyhood club for another year before moving to one of the biggest clubs in Chile, Universidad de Chile.</p><p>In January 2012, the Peruvian international signed for Universidad de Chile to take his game to the next level.</p><p>On the contrary, his time with the club turned out to be a nightmare as he fell out of favor with the manager due to a lack of playing time.</p><p>Consequently, Raul decided to sign for Cortiba until the end of the 2012 season as he wanted more playing time.</p><p>But he did not score any club goals. He impressed many scouts with his technical ability and winning mentality.</p><h3>Scoring Consistently</h3><p>Ruidiaz stayed in his home country for another four years before taking his talents elsewhere, which happened to be in Mexico.</p><p>On 1 July 2016, Mexican club Morelia signed the forward on a season-long loan deal for a reported $111,832 (€105,000).</p><p>The Peruvian international scored on his home debut in a 2-2 draw against Queretaro, which indicated the sign of things to come in the future. That&nbsp;is precisely what happened as Raul finished the season as the top scorer in Liga MX with 11 goals.</p><p>The talented soccer player finished the season with 20 goals and a solitary assist in his 34 appearances in all competitions.</p><p>As a result of his outstanding first season with the club, clubs in the MLS circle around the Morelia striker, but Morelia convinced Raul to stay with them and help them as they were among the primary candidates relegated.</p><p>The Lima native did exactly what was expected of him as he helped his side to avoid relegation through his goals.</p><p>Ruidiaz scored the winning goal in a 2-1 victory against Monterrey that helped Morelia avoid relegation.</p><p>He also finished as the top scorer in Liga MX for the second consecutive season. Likewise, Ruidiaz ended with 21 goals and three assists in 39 appearances for the club.</p><p>Following his heroic performances and loyalty, Morelia decided to grant Raul’s wishes as they put him on the auction block.</p><p>Consequently, many top clubs showed interest in the Peruvian international as he had established himself as a lethal goal scorer.</p><h4>Seattle Sounders FC</h4><p>Seattle Sounders FC managed to sign Ruidiaz for $7.5 million in 2018.</p><p>Soon after signing the contract with the Sounders, he became one of the league’s highest-paid players.</p><p>Raul’s years of hard work and dedication had finally paid off as he earned in the millions.</p><p>To nobody’s surprise, Ruidiaz immediately impacted his new club as he became the fastest player in Seattle Sounder’s history to reach 10 goals in just 14 games.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, Raul became the club’s first player to score in eight consecutive games.</p><p>Ruidiaz helped his team finish second in the Western Conference standings. But sadly, they lost to the Portland Timbers in the Western Conference semifinals.</p><p>Nevertheless, he showed precisely why the Sounders paid such a huge fee for him, as he finished the season with 13 goals and one assist in just 16 appearances.</p><p>The following season was even better for the Peruvian striker as he managed to score 15 goals and provide five assists in 26 appearances.</p><p>He also helped the Seattle-based franchise reach its second consecutive playoffs by finishing second once more.</p><p>Raul helped his team win the MLS Cup, winning the final 3-1 against Toronto FC.</p><p>Furthermore, Ruidiaz scored his side’s third and final goal in the 90th minute, putting the icing on the cake of his terrific season.</p><p>At the time of writing, only two games have been played in the MLS due to the world pandemic of Coron Virus (COVID-19).</p><p>Due to the virus, all the top sporting leagues worldwide have been postponed, including the MLS.</p><p>However, we fully believe in Ruidiaz and the Sounders to defend their title whenever the league resumes.</p><p>He contributed two goals in a 3-0 win in the second leg against UNAM in the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League final, in which his team had their first title in the competition by winning 5-2 on aggregate.</p><p><strong>Read Here <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ansu Fati Bio: Stats, Career, Salary, Net Worth, Nationality >></a></strong></p><h3>International Career</h3><p>Raul made his international debut for Peru on 7 June 2011 against Japan in the Kirin Cup.</p><p>Subsequently, the Lima-born striker was included in the Copa America squad of Peru that finished third.</p><p>After that, the&nbsp;striker played in the Copa America Centenario in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Raul-Trophy.webp><p>His most memorable moment of the Copa game was against Brazil, as he scored a controversial winner in a 1-0 victory that helped Peru secure the top spot in Group B.</p><p>After that, Raul made his first World Cup appearance at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.</p><p>Subsequently, Ruididaz appeared in two matches as a substitute but did not score any goals.</p><p>Raul has played in 53 matches for his national team scoring four goals and assisting four times.</p><p>Although the tally may seem bleak for an outstanding goal-scorer, he has not been able to cement a starting spot in the Peruvian team.</p><p>Nonetheless, judging by his excellent club form for Seattle Sounders, we have complete confidence in Raul to earn a starting spot in Peru’s national team.</p><p><strong>Learn Here About <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erling Haaland Bio: Stats, Father, Goals, Contract, TransferMarkt Wiki >></a></strong></p><h2>Raul Ruidiaz | Height & Body Measurements</h2><p>Most soccer players hit their peak in their 20s, and he is no different, as he scored 11 goals in his 22 appearances for the Sounders.</p><p>The Seattle striker stands at 1.69 meters, which is relatively small for a forward as they need to battle with strong and tall defenders.</p><p>Nevertheless, Ruidiaz has turned his disadvantage into an advantage as his low center of gravity helps him change directions and smoothly past defenders.</p><p>Additionally, his pace and trickery help the Peruvian international score goals from anywhere on the field.</p><p>As a result, Raul is one of the most feared strikers playing in the MLS.</p><h2>Raul Ruidiaz | Relationships, Wife & Children</h2><p>Raul is in a loving relationship with his wife, Pia Ruidiaz.
