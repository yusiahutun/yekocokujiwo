I don’t feel like I have picked the right people.” Domynique points out that because “it just seems like there’s a lack of commitment or maybe fear of commitment, what better way to avoid that than to go into a process, like, knowing <a href=#>you’re going to get married</a>?”</p><p>The Lifetime personality grins at the camera before concluding, “I am just looking for, like, my full-time, permanent cuddle buddy.”</p><p>Domynique and Mack, 33, will join four other Tennessee-based couples looking for love — and an arranged marriage — on the new season of the fan-favorite reality show, which has produced 13 successful marriages (and eight children!) since the 2014 series premiere.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Married-at-First-Sight-Season-16-Star-Dom-Reveals-Her-Mom-Signed-Her-Up-for-the-Show-2-e1672783452124.jpg><p>According to Dom’s <a href=#>Lifetime</a> bio, “she is confident she is ready for marriage,” despite not having extensive long-term relationships. “When she does date, it is with the intention of settling down and finding something meaningful,” the official blurb continues, noting that “unfortunately, the bar scene and dating apps are not working out for her as she doubts that is where she’ll meet her perfect match.”</p><p>Mackinley, for his part, “recently moved to Nashville to pursue new career opportunities and found himself with the best opportunity of all, finding a wife,” his official bio reads. “He is ready to settle down and looking to start a family. He has always put his career first, but he is now looking to build a life with his forever partner.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to Dom and Mack, longtime MAFS experts and matchmakers<strong> Dr. Pepper Schwartz</strong> and<strong> Pastor Cal Roberson</strong> will also guide newlyweds<strong> Jasmine</strong> and <strong>Airris</strong>,<strong> Kirsten</strong> and<strong> Shaquille</strong>,<strong> Gina</strong> and<strong> Clint</strong> as well as <strong>Nicole</strong> and <strong>Christopher</strong> throughout their new romances.</p><p>Married at First Sight season 16 premieres Wednesday, January 4, at 8 p.m. ET on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSanqNisbC5jKucr52RocBuuc6mZKyhl6OypXnHnqlmraBis7C%2BjKyfqK9dnrtuv8SaqqimXWaDbr%2FNnpikZaCasqx7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swifts-hidden-message-to-travis-kelce-at-concert-that-no-one-noticed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift's hidden message to Travis Kelce at concert that no one noticed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./show-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to Show Hidden Files and Folders in Windows</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
