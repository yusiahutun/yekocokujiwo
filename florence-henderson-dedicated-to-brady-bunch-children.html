My dad was a periodic alcoholic,” Florence told </span><i><span>Closer</span></i><span> in 2015. “It was such a difficult time in my life, but I learned not to judge or blame people for their situations.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 1952, Florence made her Broadway debut, and for the next 14 years divided her time between theater, commercials and TV gigs. But she wasn’t looking to star in a series, and she turned down the opportunity to audition for </span><i><span>The Brady Bunch</span></i><span> in 1969. “I said, ‘I don’t want to do a series — I live in New York!’” she recalled. Of course, Florence eventually agreed to try out and got the job.</span></p><p><span>As they’d done throughout her career, Florence’s kids often accompanied her to the </span><i><span>Brady Bunch</span></i><span> set. “It was important to her to have her kids with her, and we knew how to behave on the set,” explains her eldest, </span><b>Joseph Bernstein</b><span>. “She wanted us there and to be part of it all.” Her kids even appeared as extras on episodes. “We were made to feel very welcome,” son </span><b>Robert Bernstein</b><span> recalls. For Florence, it was all about sharing her love of performing with her family. “I tried to make them a part of my life because show business has been very good to me,” she said. “And, hopefully, teach them that you could retain some humanity and do those things for a living.”</span></p><p><span>Along the way, Florence also blended the </span><i><span>Brady</span></i><span> actors into her home bunch. Susan Olsen became close friends with her daughter Elizabeth and often slept over. Florence also hosted an annual joint birthday party for her son Robert and Susan because their birthdays were close. “We spent so many hours together with the kids, and I sort of became like a second mother to them,” she said.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Florence-Henderson.jpg><p><span>For Barry Williams, who played Greg, Florence was at her best during the show’s famed Hawaii episodes. “We were together for a couple of weeks, even at meals. We would wake up, go to work and have fun,” he recalled. “Florence always made everything, especially that trip, extra fun.”</span></p><p><span>Despite her best efforts, it wasn’t always easy to be Florence’s children. “I always felt we stole the limelight from [her real kids],” admits Susan. And as the show’s popularity grew, more people recognized Florence as Carol.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Fans were only interested in seeing her with her TV children,” explains a friend. “Florence shared a story of how Elizabeth pulled on her skirt and pleaded with her to tell fans that she was her real daughter.” Their school friends also clamored to meet Mrs. Brady. “Their peers kind of confused ideas about who I was and what I was,” Florence said. “It was a tough experience for them at times.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After </span><i><span>The Brady Bunch </span></i><span>was canceled in 1974, Florence struggled with stage fright but eventually returned to performing. She never found another role that could eclipse Carol Brady, who became even more popular in syndication. “People would constantly approach, and she was never rude to one person or turn away anyone,” says Elizabeth. “And if they had a story to tell or share with her about how much </span><i><span>The Brady Bunch</span></i><span> meant to them, she would listen. And her response would always be heartfelt and sincere.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In later life, <a href=#>Florence, who died in 2016 at age 82</a>, remained energetic and upbeat. “She was living her life fully to the last moment,” says daughter Barbara Chase. Florence enjoyed spoiling her five grandchildren and remained close with her own kids — as well as the </span><i><span>Brady</span></i><span> actors — until the end. “That’s how you know how good a mom she was,” says Susan. “Two families and a career, and her kids still turned out terrific.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46fo6iqlaOwpnnHnqWdnaKovK95w56bopuRqbKledOoZJuqkZnGbq7Up5qhZZOdtq2w0Z6laA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meaning-of-dancing-on-the-ceiling-by-frank-sinatra.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meaning of Dancing on the Ceiling by Frank Sinatra</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chinas-submarines-can-be-quieter-more-powerful-new-pump-jet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chinas submarines can be quieter, more powerful with new pump-jet: scientists</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
