You can add live TV and premium networks like HBO Max and Starz for an additional cost.</p><p>The Hulu app for Nintendo Switch is only available in the US—which makes sense, since Hulu doesn't serve any other territories. The cheapest Hulu plan costs $7.99/month, which is supported by ads, though <a href=#>Hulu has ad-free subscription plans</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=youtube>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/youtube-homepage-on-nintendo-switch.jpg><p>YouTube is available on the Nintendo Switch and is completely free, though it's ad-supported—to get rid of those, you'll need a subscription to YouTube Premium. If you've ever used YouTube on another console or smart TV, you'll be familiar with the app.</p><p>You can search for videos, browse your library, and interact with the community just like you can when browsing YouTube on a desktop. Unfortunately, one of the main things that you can't do is upload video, either through the YouTube app or Nintendo's video sharing functionality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=crunchyroll>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crunchyroll</a></h2><p>If you're an anime fan, chances are that you've heard of Crunchyroll. It's the ultimate streaming destination for all things anime, featuring over 1,000 shows in multiple languages, including classics like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure and One Piece. You can also stream Crunchyroll Originals, which are shows produced by the company and mostly exclusive to the service.</p><p><a href=#>Crunchyroll offers free and paid viewing</a>. A reasonably sized catalog of shows are available to stream for free, supported by ads. But if you want to watch new anime, download shows for offline viewing, and have no ads, you'll need to subscribe to Crunchyroll Premium. Plans begin at $7.99/month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=funimation>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Funimation</a></h2><p>Funimation is an anime streaming service available for the Nintendo Switch. You can download Funimation from the eShop in the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, and other countries.</p><p>You need a Funimation Premium membership to stream on the Switch, which begins at $7.99/month or $79.99/year. Handily, you can sign up on your Nintendo Switch, so there's no need to use another device. There's a 14-day free trial available if you want to test Funimation Premium before paying.</p><p>However, <a href=#>Funimation subscribers should consider switching to Crunchyroll</a>. This is because the two companies unified under the Crunchyroll brand in March 2022. Eventually, Funimation will likely shut down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pok-eacute-mon-tv>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon TV</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pokemon-tv.jpg><p>Pokémon is one of the most famous game franchises that you can play on Nintendo consoles, so it makes sense that the series has its own streaming service on the Switch.</p><p><a href=#>Pokémon TV offers a free way to watch the cartoon series</a>. Although not every episode is available, plenty are, ranging from the original to the modern series. The app also plays hosts to animated specials and highlights from Pokémon tournaments.</p><p>There's also a special section for youngsters, featuring sing-a-long songs and nursery rhymes.</p><h2 id=twitch>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/twitch-channel-page-on-nintendo-switch.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Twitch is a live-streaming platform</a> that allows anyone to broadcast themselves, usually playing games. It doesn't cost anything to watch Twitch streams, nor do you need an account, though some streamers encourage donations and there are <a href=#>various paid Twitch subscriptions</a>.</p><p>Like the desktop experience, the Twitch Switch app lets you find streams by game or genre, and you can get watching within seconds. The interface is simple, but it works smoothly.</p><p>Unfortunately, the app is missing many of Twitch's key features. For example, there's no in-built chat; instead, you have to scan a QR code on your phone and type there. Additionally, you can't stream yourself through the Twitch app. So if you had visions of broadcasting a game of Mario Kart directly through the console, you're out of luck.</p><h2 id=how-to-download-streaming-apps-on-nintendo-switch>How to Download Streaming Apps on Nintendo Switch</h2><p>To download any of these apps on your Nintendo Switch, go to the console's home screen and open the Nintendo eShop (the <strong>shopping bag icon</strong>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you don't have an internet connection and/or a Nintendo account, you will be guided through the setup process. Both are mandatory.</p><p>Once you're in, select <strong>Search</strong> from the left-hand navigation. Select the app, then choose <strong>Free Download</strong>. This will take you through to a screen called <strong>Confirm Items to Purchase</strong>, but don't worry because that's just the generic name for this checkout page.</p><p>Press <strong>Free Download</strong> again and the app will download to your Nintendo Switch and be available from the home screen when done.</p><h2 id=can-you-get-netflix-on-nintendo-switch>Can You Get Netflix on Nintendo Switch?</h2><p>No. At the time of writing, you cannot get Netflix on the Nintendo Switch. In fact, you can't get many popular streaming services on the Switch, since the console is also missing the likes of Disney+, Max (formerly HBO Max), and Amazon Prime Video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 2017 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>, Nintendo of America's then-president Reggie Fils-Aime said that Nintendo built the Switch to primarily be a "world-class gaming device". He also stated that Nintendo was talking to "companies like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon" and support for those streaming apps would "come in time".</p><p>Fast-forward many years later and only one of those services that Fils-Aime mentioned is available on the Nintendo Switch.</p><p>That said, you can access these apps by installing Android on your Nintendo Switch. This will void your warranty and is only recommended for advanced users.</p><h2 id=play-great-nintendo-switch-games>Play Great Nintendo Switch Games</h2><p>As you can see, the Nintendo Switch doesn't have many streaming apps. Let's hope that more are available soon; if there's a particular one you want, it's worth emailing that streaming company to register your interest.</p><p>Until then, don't sleep on the huge selection of great games that you can play on the Switch. After all, as Fils-Aime said, the Switch is primarily a gaming device.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiloqakmrulu4ysrqKsk516tMDRnpimoZ6cerSx0a%2BgnJ2jZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brigitte-macron-dons-nude-utility-dress-joins-melania-trump-g7-summit-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brigitte Macron dons nude utility dress as she joins Melania Trump at the G7 summit</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bite-plate-better-sleep.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This Bite Plate Could Be the Key to a Better Night's Sleep</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
