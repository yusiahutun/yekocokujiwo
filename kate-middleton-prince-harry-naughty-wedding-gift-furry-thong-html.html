In fact, after her wedding to his brother Prince William, Harry gifted her a risque item, a furry thong, that she found hilarious. Here are all the details.</p><h2 id=h-kate-middleton-was-on-the-receiving-end-of-prince-harry-s-naughty-wedding-gift>Kate Middleton was on the receiving end of Prince Harry’s naughty wedding gift</h2><p id=par-2_46>After her wedding to Prince William in 2011, Kate Middleton received a naughty gift from her new brother-in-law, Prince Harry. The Duke of Sussex recounted the events of the hilarious moment after the 2011 royal wedding in his book Spare, as reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mirror</a>.</p><p id=par-3_25>The royal family gathered together after the ceremony for a Buckingham Palace reception. There, Harry delivered an improvised speech for the new bride and groom.</p><p id=par-4_25>Harry shared heartfelt sentiments of the couple and funny memories from his and William’s childhood. However, one moment in particular left the crowd in hysterics.</p><p id=par-5_37>Harry read letters sent to William and Kate from people around the world. This included a note reportedly from one man in the United States who tried to capture 1,000 stoats to create a garment for Kate.</p><p id=par-6_43>However, since the man reportedly only caught two in one year, there was only enough fur gathered to craft the smallest piece of clothing, an ermine thong. Harry kept the gag going as he finished reading the letter, then reached into his pocket.</p><p id=par-7_23>He then pulled the furry thong out and waved it before Kate. In turn, she found the gag hilarious and broke into laughter.</p><p id=par-8_39>Harry concluded his speech by remembering his and William’s late mother, Princess Diana. He shared with the attendees that Diana would have loved to be there for the wedding and that she would have loved his furry thong joke.</p><h2>Prince Harry shared he wasn’t Prince William’s best man in ‘Spare’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prince-Harry-on-the-cover-of-Spare.jpg><p id=par-9_23>In Spare, Prince Harry revealed other surprising news about Prince William’s to Kate Middleton. Reportedly, he was technically not his brother’s best man.</p><p id=par-10_25>Instead, William’s friends, James Meade and Thomas van Straubenzee were the best men. Here’s what Harry had to say about his position at the wedding.</p><p id=par-11_42>“The public had been told I was to be the best man, but that was a bare-faced lie. The public expected me to be the best man, and thus, the Palace saw no choice but to say that I was,” Harry explained.</p><p id=par-12_42>Harry continued, “In truth, Willy didn’t want me giving a best-man speech. He didn’t think it safe to hand me a live mic and put me in a position to go off script. I might say something wildly inappropriate. He wasn’t wrong.”</p><p id=par-13_33>He added the lie helped to cover James and Thomas’ identities. Harry believed the press would have hounded the men had the news leaked of their critical roles in William and Kate’s wedding.</p><p id=par-14_46>“Both chaps were shy, quiet. They couldn’t handle such an onslaught and shouldn’t be expected to,” Harry wrote. “Willy explained all this to me, and I didn’t blink. I understood. We even laughed about it, speculating about the inappropriate things I might’ve said in my speech.”</p><h2>Royal protocol dictated what the brothers wore on Prince William’s wedding day</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-15_38>Prince Harry also noted that the Palace dictated his and his brother’s clothing on William’s wedding day. Harry admitted William did not want to wear the red uniform of the Irish Guards that he donned in April 2011.</p><p id=par-16_32>Instead, William wanted to wear his Household Cavalry uniform, which Queen Elizabeth rejected. Harry tried to reassure his brother that he looked great in the heavily decorated red jacket and black pants.</p><p id=par-17_38>“I assured [William] that he looked bloody smart in the Harp of Ireland, with the Crown Imperial and the forage cap with the regimental motto:&nbsp;Quis Separabit? Who shall separate us?&nbsp;It didn’t seem to make an impression,” he explained.</p><p id=par-18_56>However, Harry noted he, too, was uncomfortable in the outfit chosen for him on that day. “I, on the other hand, did not look smart, nor did I feel comfortable, in my Blues and Royals uniform, which protocol dictated that I wear. I’d never worn it before and hoped not to wear it again anytime soon.”</p><p id=par-19_43>The relationship between Prince Harry, Kate Middleton, and <a href=#>Prince William remains estranged</a>. Their <a href=#>royal rift </a>occurred after Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, left their roles as senior royals in 2020 and began speaking out against the royal family one year later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS4osDEZqSinJShsrW7zWanq6GemLJutMCrqbJlnpbCqLTTsmSwnZSZtq%2BzjKCgn6xdm8Kzvthmq6Gnnpx7qcDMpWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./535529-meet-founder-seas-technologies-awarded-ksh-16b-govt-cancelled-digitisation-tender.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Founder of SevenSeas Technologies Awarded KSh 1.6b after Govt Cancelled Digitisation Tender</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./helen-labdon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Helen Labdon Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
