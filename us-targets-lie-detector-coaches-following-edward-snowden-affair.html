violators and leakers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The criminal inquiry, which has not been acknowledged publicly, is aimed at discouraging criminals and spies from infiltrating the US government by using the polygraph-beating techniques, which are said to include controlled breathing, muscle- tensing, tongue-biting and mental arithmetic.</p><a class="colorbox colorbox-insert-image euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0

examples of the Obama administration's emphasis on rooting out "insider threats," referring to employees who might become spies and leak to the media such as Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who revealed the agency's secret data-collection programmes.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Obama administration launched the offensive in 2011 after US Army private Bradley Manning downloaded hundreds of thousands of classified documents and sent them to WikiLeaks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So far, the authorities have targeted at least two instructors, one of whom has pleaded guilty to federal charges, several people familiar with the investigation said. Investigators confiscated business records from the two men, which included the names of as many as 5,000 people who had sought polygraph-beating advice. US agencies have determined that at least 20 of them applied for government and federal contracting jobs, and at least half of them were hired, including by the National Security Agency.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By attempting to prosecute the instructors, federal officials are adopting a controversial legal stance that sharing such information should be treated as a crime and is not protected under the First Amendment, which guarantees free speech.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Nothing like this has been done before," John Schwartz, a US Customs and Border Protection official, said of the legal approach. "Most certainly our nation's security will be enhanced.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"There are a lot of bad people out there. This will help us remove some of those pests from society."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The federal government previously treated such instructors only as nuisances, partly because the polygraph-beating techniques are unproven. Instructors have openly advertised and discussed their techniques and as many as 30 people or businesses claim they can teach how to beat a polygraph test, the US government estimates.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Authorities have launched stings targeting Doug Williams, a former Oklahoma City police polygrapher, and Chad Dixon, an Indiana man who is said to have been inspired by Williams' book on the techniques, people who are familiar with the investigation said. Dixon has pleaded guilty to federal charges of obstructing an agency proceeding and wire fraud. Prosecutors plan to ask a federal judge to sentence Dixon to two years in prison.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Williams, a self-professed "crusader" who has railed against the use of polygraph testing, and who has openly advertised his teachings, said he has done nothing wrong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Several people familiar with the investigation said Dixon and Williams had agreed to meet with undercover agents and teach them how to pass polygraph tests for a fee. The agents then posed as people connected to a drug trafficker and as a correctional officer who had smuggled drugs into a jail and had received a sexual favour from an underage girl.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dixon declined to say what he was paid but it is thought people involved with countermeasures training generally charge US$1,000 for a one-on-one session.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Never in my wildest dreams did I somehow imagine I was committing a crime," Dixon said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Wisconsin police chief, Russell Ehlers, sold a video while off-duty that discussed countermeasures, but he said he had recently stopped selling it after hearing about the criminal investigation. He said he had wanted to help "good" police candidates pass the test and added that innocent people were routinely accused of lying during polygraph tests.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Lie-detector test 'cheats' hunted</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2Z%2FeoOVa2loraNiwaK%2Bxp6rrGWcnrJusMStnJysn6d6pLvAnJ%2Beq12bvK24zrCgp59dmrG4rdGdZKymn6yxprqMmp2fmZmn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./billie-eilish-reveals-brand-new-back-tattoo-latest-photo-fan-frenzy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Billie Eilish reveals bold new body transformation, sparks fan frenzy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tamara-mowry-housley-today-show-suit.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sister Sister star Tamera Mowry-Housley makes a statement in bold pink and royally chic earrings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
