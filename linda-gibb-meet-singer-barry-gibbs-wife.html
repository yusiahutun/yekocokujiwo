However, she came into the limelight following her marriage to Barry Gibb. Her husband, Barry, is a famous British musician, songwriter, and record producer known for his hit tracks such as “Stayin’ Alive” and “How Deep is Your Love.”</p><p>In addition, Barry is famous as one of the founding members of the “Bee Gees,” a legendary pop and disco group, in the 1970s.&nbsp;Aside from being a celebrity spouse, Linda Gibb is a former model who won the Miss Edinburgh crown in 1967. Also, she doubled as a BBC presenter.</p><p>However, her relationship with Barry propelled her to stardom. Despite marrying the renowned British musician and songwriter, Linda Gibb maintains a private lifestyle. Hence, many are curious about her. Here’s everything we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-18_05-15-01-fotor-2023101852253.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Barry_Gibbs_Wife></span>How Old Is Barry Gibb’s Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Barry Gibb’s wife is 73 years old. She was born Linda Gray in Musselburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom, on May 11, 1950. Due to her cagey lifestyle, most details about her early life elude the media. However, reports suggest Linda Gibb grew up with her parents and siblings in Musselburgh, Scotland, UK.</p><p>Like most details about her early life, the identity of her parents and siblings also elude the media. Although there are no details regarding her early life and family background, reports suggest that the former model is of mixed ethnicity.</p><p>In addition, Barry Gibb’s wife is also British-American by nationality. Despite being the wife of a renowned singer, Linda has yet to reveal details of her educational background. Consequently, there is no information regarding her academic achievements.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Linda_Gibb_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Linda Gibb Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like details regarding her early life and upbringing, there is little information about Linda’s career. Before marrying the renowned musician Linda Gibb pursued a career in the fashion and entertainment industry. She worked as a model for many years and graced several runways throughout her career. Consequently, she won the Miss Edinburgh title in 1967, at the height of her career.</p><p>Aside from her modeling career, Barry Gibb’s spouse also worked as a TV presenter for the BBC show “Top of the Pop.” However, following her marriage to Barry, Linda retired from her career to focus on her family. Although she had a short career in modeling and TV presenting, Linda’s talent and striking features left a lasting impression in the minds of her audiences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-18_05-14-37-fotor-2023101852932.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Linda_Gibb_and_Her_Husband_Meet></span>When Did Linda Gibb and Her Husband Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Linda Gibb and her husband first met in London, United Kingdom, on the “Top of the Pops” TV set in 1976. While speaking in an interview, the British singer disclosed love at first sight. Hence,&nbsp;after Barry’s band performed, the two went to a nearby studio, where they talked and fell in love with each other.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Barry_Gibb_and_Linda_Tie_the_Knot></span>When Did Barry Gibb and Linda Tie the Knot?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After dating for almost three years, Linda Gibb and <a href=#>Barry Gibb</a> exchanged wedding vows on September 1, 1970. However, the renowned British singer revealed they lived together before tying the knot. Before his marriage to Linda, the British singer previously tied the knot with Maureen Bates. The former couple married in 1966, when Barry was 19 years old.</p><p>However, they finalized their divorce in 1970, two months before his marriage to Linda. The couple were young at the time of their marriage; while Linda was 19, Barry was around 23. However, their marriage has stood the test of time and is one of the longest-standing celebrity marriages. Despite being a high-profile union, the couple keeps their marriage scandal-free and away from the limelight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-18_05-15-07-fotor-2023101851916.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Linda_Gibbs_Children></span>Who Are Linda Gibb’s Children?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Linda Gibb and her spouse are parents to five children. The couple welcomed their first child, Stephen Thadeus Crompton Gibb, on December 1, 1973. Stephen was born in London, United Kingdom, but grew up in Miami, United States.</p><p>Stephen followed in his father’s footsteps by pursuing a career in the entertainment industry as a guitarist, composer, and actor. In addition, he tied the knot with Gloria Levas, and they share two children.</p><p>Afterward, Linda and Barry welcomed their second son. Their second son, Ashley Robert Crompton, was born in Miami, Florida, on September 8, 1977. Like his older brother, Ashley followed in his father’s footsteps by becoming a musician.</p><p>Next is Travis Gibb, the couple’s third son. Travis was born on January 10, 1981, and is 42 years old. However, he lives away from the limelight.&nbsp;After Travis comes Michael, the couple’s fourth son.</p><p>Michael was born on&nbsp; December 1, 1984. He is an American actor known for his appearances in films such as “The Principal of Monster Lake,” “Stan the Man” and “Bad Actress.” Like his brother, Stephen, Michael married his sweetheart, Jenna Morhaim, and he is a father of three children.</p><p>Lastly is the couple’s only daughter, Alexandra Gibb. She was born on December 29, 1991. Like Travis, most details about Alexander elude the media as she also shies away from the limelight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-18_05-15-13-fotor-202310185292.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Linda_Gibb_Still_Alive></span>Is Linda Gibb Still Alive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, she is. Linda Gibb and her husband are aging beautifully and living in the United States. The couple have been together for over fifty-two years and are still going strong. Despite being together for a long time, they have had no controversies in their marriage.</p><p>Like Jackie Chan’s wife, <a href=#>Joan Lin</a>, Linda Gibb enjoys a life of luxury away from the limelight. Aside from spending quality time with her husband and children, Barry Gibb’s wife also gets occupied with her grandchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuaq6w5pkoKGSl3quscStZKyhnpyys3nBmqmrsV2ctqOu0mauop6VZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mouni-roy-poses-with-showtime-co-stars-emraan-hashmi-shriya-saran-see-happy-pics-1280271.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mouni Roy poses with Showtime co-stars Emraan Hashmi, Shriya Saran; see happy PICS</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./j-balvin-leads-latin-grammy-noms-ahead-of-beyonce.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>J Balvin Leads Latin Grammy Noms, Ahead Of Beyonc</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
