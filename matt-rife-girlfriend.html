However, he got his big break on&nbsp;<a href=#>TikTok</a>&nbsp;where he has amassed over 13 million followers and more than 2 billion views globally. The comedian announced his tour on<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;Youtube</a>&nbsp;with the help of celebrity couple Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis.</p><p>“When the TikTok stuff and social media stuff started to blow up, [my audience] was definitely, I’d say, 95% women from 16 to 25, which is a very, very powerful fan base,” he told <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/matt-rife-interview-tiktok-dating rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Elite Daily</a>. “And I’m so thankful for it. They’re very online. They’re not always the best stand-up comedy audience members. A lot of the time they like my face a lot more than my jokes, which is fine. It gets them in the door, and then hopefully you keep them with the comedy.”</p><p>He continued that he “prioritized women a lot when I was younger,” which led to “a lot of healthy and a lot of unhealthy relationships” in his past.</p><p>In the same interview, he opened up about how he was busy with his comedy career to be dating. “I just don’t have time. I’m on the brink of being sick almost every day. Not in a <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1387932/john-mulaney-dating/ rel="noreferrer noopener">cold kind of way</a>, but just being run-down. I don’t sleep. I sleep probably three hours a night, maybe. And then I’ve got basically at least two shows every night, I’d say six days a week at least. So, a lot of times I’ll get done with shows. I’ll go back to my hotel, I’ll maybe smoke a little bit to unwind, and then I just edit for the next probably hour and a half.”</p><p>Rife&nbsp;also <a href=# rel=nofollow>told GQ</a>, “I kind of hate dating. I know I am just in my mid-to-late 20s, but still, I do want a wife and a family and a prominent home life that makes me feel comfortable, safe, and is my peace. But when I’m touring six days a week, 52 weeks out of the year, it’s incredibly hard to maintain a relationship.”</p><p>He continued, “I do meet women who are fantastic human beings that I’m like, ‘Wow, you’re such a lovely person. You’re beautiful. You’re sweet, you’re kind, you’d be an excellent mother and excellent wife, excellent girlfriend, you check all these boxes, but I might not be in a position right now to fulfill your needs as a responsible boyfriend.’”</p><p>However, a couple of weeks later, the comedian was confirmed to be cuffed.

Lord is an English dancer and actress who has known the comedian for several years.</p><p>It was confirmed in June 2023 that the two were in a relationship. “<a href=# rel=nofollow>It’s newer</a>, but I mean I do prefer to keep it on the more private side. Just because, I mean, people are literally insane,” he told People in October 2023. He also added that Lord has been “so important to my infrastructure,” when planning out his daily routine. “She forces me to take personal time, obviously, and I love that. Whenever she’s like, ‘Can we have tomorrow for ourselves?’ I’m like, ‘Thank you. I would love to have that.’ ”</p><p>He added, “She’s the most concerned about my sleep problem. She’s always making sure I’m eating that day and making sure I get my work done so that I can have the free time.”</p><p>He’s occasionally mentioned her in his comedy sets. “She loves it,” he said. “She’s British, so she has like the best sense of humor.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.95789473684211><h2>Lucy Hale (2023)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lucy-hale.jpg><p>Matt Rife had a brief fling with Lucy Hale in 2023, per<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://pagesix.com/2023/07/09/hot-new-comic-matt-rife-dating-actress-jessica-lord-after-lucy-hale-split/> Page Six</a>.

Beckinsale was 44 years old at the time while Rife was 21. Rife went viral after telling <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.tmz.com/2019/03/05/pete-davidson-kate-beckinsale-dating-advice-ex-comedian-matt-rife/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> the kind of advice he would give Pete Davidson, who dated the model after him. In 2019, he told the paps his advice, “Man to man? Run.”</p><p>“Enjoy it while you can,” he continued. “I hope they’re both happy, I hope that it can build to where it’s an established, good relationship.”</p><p>In 2023, he reflected on the viral moment. “I gave that advice because I was only speaking from personal experience, having been together and finding out that we weren’t the most compatible match,” he said in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Elle‘s Thirst Trap video</a>. “I wanted to make sure that both of them were careful with their emotions and didn’t head into something that they also wouldn’t, that also wouldn’t work out.”</p><p>“I gave the advice to be careful because I had just gotten out of a relationship with somebody that I unfortunately found out we weren’t compatible,” he said. “And I always want people to, you know, protect their emotions and their personal feelings.”</p><p>“And I told him to run because I was being a petty a–hole. I regret saying that,”&nbsp;Matt&nbsp;added. “Pete, if you’re out there, sorry I said that.&nbsp;Kate, I also apologize that I said that. I shouldn’t have said that.”</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfoq61wIyroJ%2BdXZy2s7jFq6CeppRk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./13-going-30-outfits-15th-anniversary.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Outfits From 13 Going on 30 Are Basically Perfect ]</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-lewis-jenni-pulos-flipping-out.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Lewis Details Run-In With Jenni Pulos After Flipping Out Falling Out</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
