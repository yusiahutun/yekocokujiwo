In the clip, the Pirates of the Caribbean star wore an all-black outfit and a variety of silver jewelry.</p><p>"An eagle cries as it circles its prey. The blazing sun high in the ozone-blue sky," Depp says in the ad. "A trail of cold wind stirs a land of dry wood and stone. This is the call of Sauvage Eau."</p><p>Dior also posted in honor of Depp's return as the perfume's spokesperson on its Instagram, sharing the new ad as well as photos and clips from previous campaigns.</p><p>"Bold and powerful, in his essence, his truth, @JohnnyDepp embodies the soul of Sauvage," the French luxury fashion house captioned a throwback photo of Depp.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The Sweeney Todd star has been the face of the fragrance since 2015. While he was dropped from several projects in the wake of Heard's allegations and his loss in the UK libel case, Dior not only stood by Depp, but also reportedly offered him the biggest men's fragrance deal of all time, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Variety</strong></a>. The outlet reported that Depp signed a three-year deal with Dior worth over $20 million.</p><p>Depp's new Dior Sauvage campaign is the first he's starred in since his and Heard's defamation trailer last year.</p><p>In June 2022, following six weeks of testimony and wall-to-wall media coverage, a verdict was reached in the actor's defamation trial -- and the jury mostly sided with Depp, ruling that Heard had defamed Depp in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed. They awarded $10 million dollars to Depp in compensatory damages, plus $5 million in punitive damages.</p><p>Heard, 37, did score a minor victory herself, with the jury deciding statements made by Depp's lawyer Adam Waldman were defamatory -- and awarded her $2 million in compensatory damages.</p><p>They both appealed the verdict, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>but settled last December</strong></a>.</p><a id=gallery-link-4889e887-0446-4dbd-958f-15ee884128fb class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:4889e887-0446-4dbd-958f-15ee884128fb data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:786ee1f1-0c8b-4b08-89e6-5bb7d4e19a2d data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/73/4by3/2023/08/31/73baf6b5e0114672881e5d4e079dd3da_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmaXFfn7ypus2yZJ2doKV6s7HTrqmnq12brqSxjJ2gqKpdqK62wsCgnGaemafAtXnAnWSsoZ6Ysm6tzJucq2WYmq6zsIytqaKZnGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./persistence-needed-ensure-hong-kongs-pilot-recycling-scheme-not-waste.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Opinion | Persistence needed to ensure Hong Kongs pilot recycling scheme is not a waste</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-prescott-just-friends-emilia-jones-spotted-smooching-irish-eurovision-star-conor-odonohoe-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>EMILY PRESCOTT: Are you still just friends?
