But none of them had more of an impact on this generation than Sammi “Sweetheart” <a href=#>Giancola</a> and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro from <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a>.</p><p id=par-2_31>The couple had one of the most tumultuous relationships in reality television history. And while Giancola may be engaged to boyfriend Christian Biscardi, she’ll always be Ortiz-Magro’s girl in our hearts.</p><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-3_9>Let’s take a look back at the rocky relationship.</p><p id=par-4_43>It all started back in the summer of 2009 when Jersey Shore first aired. On the first night, Giancola had to make a choice between Ortiz-Magro and Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino. She ultimately chose the former and the two began their summer fling.</p><p id=par-5_35>The couple ended the season together, but their relationship wasn’t in the clear yet. During the season one live reunion, the two broke up after footage was aired of a conversation between Sorrentino and Giancola.</p><p id=par-6_49>In April of 2010, the two were reunited for season two of the show. The pair claimed that they had not spoken since the reunion. At the beginning of the season, Ortiz-Magro went out and hooked up with a few girls, only to return home and sleep with Giancola.</p><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_36>Seeing this,&nbsp;Jenni “JWoww” Farley&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi&nbsp;wrote the Jersey Shore sweetheart an annonymous letter detailing all of the things that her boyfriend did. Despite receiving the letter, Giancola stayed with the guido for a little while longer.</p><p id=par-8_44>In season three of the show, the couple became even more volatile. They fought constantly and Ortiz-Magro eventually ended up destroying Giancola’s belongings, causing her to break up with him and leave the house. She did return to the show two episodes later, though.</p><p id=par-9_40>The two toyed with the idea of getting back together throughout the rest of the season but eventually decided to stay apart when Giancola admitted that she hooked up with The Situation’s friend once before she and Ortiz-Magro were together.</p><p id=par-10_40>In 2011, the fourth season of the show took the cast to Italy. If you thought that the pair’s love drama wouldn’t cross country borders, you were wrong. The couple continued to break up and make up throughout the season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_26>The next year, was the last for Jersey Shore. At the live reunion, the pair said that they were still together and were moving in together.</p><p id=par-12_15>Their happiness didn’t last long. By 2014, the pair decided to go their separate ways.</p><p id=par-13_28>“At this time, Ronnie and I have gone our separate ways,” Giancola told<a href=#> E News</a>.” I wish him nothing but the best. Right now, I’m focused on myself.”</p><p id=par-14_36>“We were drifting apart and not really spending any time together,” her former beau <a href=#>told People</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;the time. “I still care about her. She’s a great girl, but we were growing distant. It was for the best.”</p><p id=par-15_13>On the Jersey Shore Family Vacation&nbsp;premiere, Ortiz Magro clarified why they broke up.</p><p id=par-16_41>“Once we left the shore house, me and Sam decided we were going to take the next step,” he said. “And we were getting towards that stage where it was like, I either have to s— or get off the pot.”</p><p id=par-17_70>“She gave me a timeline. She was like, I want to get married in six months—and I’m still trying to figure my life out,” he explained. “I got cold feet. I wanted to do the right thing, but there was a part of me that was like, ‘I’m not going to do the right thing.’ So I didn’t do it. I ended up cheating, she found out. I blew it.”</p><p id=par-18_21>The pair tried to make it work again for a short time in 2016 before moving on to different partners.</p><p id=par-19_9>In 2017, Giancola began dating her now fiance, Biscardi.</p><p id=par-20_2><strong>Read more:&nbsp;‘Jersey&nbsp;Shore’:&nbsp;Why&nbsp;Ronnie&nbsp;Ortiz-Magro&nbsp;Went&nbsp;to&nbsp;Rehab</strong></p><p id=par-21_5><strong>Check out&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#><strong>The Cheat Sheet</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;on Facebook!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3pr7SnrBmq5ikv6Z5y6itnmWRYsGqucSloKedXaSzbr%2FApqSiZaOssqbAx56Yq6xdlruledGopaehlah6s7HLmquip56otaq8jaGrpqRf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-use-oil-on-natural-hair.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Use Oil on Natural Hair Without Going Overboard</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./headline-for-dating-site-1230768.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>50+ Headlines for Dating Sites to Find Your Happily Ever After</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
