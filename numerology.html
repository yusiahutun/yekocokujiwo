The study of this very phenomenon is numerology.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Numerology is an ancient mystical science which attributes deeper meaning to numbers," explained&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Josh Siegel</a>, a master numerologist who has practiced for over two decades. "Its philosophy states that all things carry a unique vibration, including human beings. Modern numerology can be a powerful self-help tool that provides insight and direction."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Siegel, you can take your name and birthdate and boil it down to a numeric code that will identify unique characteristics and even life lessons. That's just one technique to keep in mind as you explore your own significant numbers.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Josh Siegel</a> is a master numerologist with over 20 years of professional experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, the basics of numerology, how various types of numbers can offer valuable intel, and the power and meaning of each number.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-numerologys-origins></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Numerology's Origins</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Numerology is rooted in philosophies that date back thousands of years to ancient Egypt, Sumer, and India.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Numbers were universally used to describe divine forces in nature," Siegel explained.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Around 2500 B.C., Greek philosopher and early mathematician Pythagoras — the same behind the Pythagorean Theorem you learned in math class — taught that all things vibrate to their number and even the planets resonate to their own frequency.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Pythagoras was said to have learned sacred knowledge from his journey to Egypt," said Siegel. "Although his life has become something of legend, traditions credit him with some of the earliest advanced mathematics, geometry, and even the development of Western music."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-your-life-path-number></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Your Life Path Number?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the first ways you can begin to work with numerology in your own life is by pinpointing your Life Path number, which can give you a sense of what your focus is on in this lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It actually signifies a challenge you were born with that brings out qualities associated with the number," noted Siegel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For example, if your Life Path number is eight, you might struggle with self-worth or empowerment but feel compelled to be a total boss in your career, vying for executive positions or starting your own business. "Over time, the 8 Life Path may learn to overcome their lessons and embody the strength inherent in their path number," explained Siegel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In other words, we're here to consider the qualities of our Life Path number, and weave them into our work and strive to manifest their higher qualities in our daily lives. As Siegel suggested, it is integral to our growth.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-calculate-your-life-path-number></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Calculate Your Life Path Number</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To figure out your Life Path number:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">1. Add the month and day of your birth date separately, then add the year together as a separate number. For example, a birth date of 11/20/1985 would be calculated this way: Add together the month and day 11 + 20 = 31. Keep the 31 aside.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">2. Now, add together all the numbers of your birth year. Keeping with this same example, 1+9+8+5 = 23.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">3. Next, add the number derived from your birth day and month to the number you landed on for your birth year. In this case, you'd get 54.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">4. Now, add the two digits together to create one single number. In this case, 5+4 = 9. So the person is a nine Life Path. In more advanced numerology, Siegel noted that you'd write it as 54/9.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-your-destiny-number></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Your Destiny Number?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can also use your full name — from your birth certificate — to come up with your Destiny number. Siegel said it's a bit of an outdated term because the number you come up with isn't exactly about your destiny. Instead, it's indicative of your innate talents. For that reason, Siegel calls it the "Natural Ability" number.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It represents capabilities that are second nature ... that you just know how to do," explained Siegel. In other words, it's not about something you need to learn or weave into your life, like the Life Path number. For the greatest success and fulfillment, you want to work with both the Life Path number and the Natural Ability number.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-calculate-your-destiny-number></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Calculate Your Destiny Number</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">1. First of all, bear in mind that every letter is associated with a number. Here's the cheat sheet on that: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=1, K=2, L=3, M=4, N=5, O=6, P=7, Q=8, R=9, S=1, T=2, U=3, V=4, W=5, X=6, Y=7, Z=8.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">2. Now, take your full name at birth (first and last). Say it's SAMANTHA BELL. That'll result in 1 1 4 1 5281 for the first name and, for the last name, 2533.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">3. Add the letters of each name separately: Samantha is 1+1+4+1+5+2+8+1 = 23. Bell is 2+5+3+3 = 13.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">4. Then, add them together: 23 + 13 = 36.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">5. Add the two digits together to create a new number. 3 + 6 = 9, meaning Samantha has a 9 Natural Ability (or Destiny) number. It may also be written 36/9, noted Siegel.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-master-numbers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Master Numbers?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are a few double-digit numbers that numerologists will not boil down to a single digit, and those are known as Master Numbers. According to Siegel, these special numbers hold great promise yet can test those who carry them in their numerology chart. Essentially, they're repeating double-digit numbers like 11, 22, 33, etc., all the way up to 99.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They carry intensity due to the doubling effect and challenge the person to rise to the potential inherent in the number," explained Siegel. "For example, a 66 (written 66/12/3) can give great talent in the creative arts or gifts in a healing profession. However, it can also make one quite sensitive and overly idealistic."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you carry a Master Number, Siegel said that you're being required to work constructively with the capabilities and talents given while learning how to handle the challenges that come from a powerful influence.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-each-number-in-numerology-means></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Each Number in Numerology Means</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's the scoop on every number's significance, which can be tapped into when working with your Life Path, Destiny, or Master numbers.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1: Originality</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The number one is associated with those who lead and create their own path," noted Siegel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_76-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">People who have this number as a Life Path or Natural Ability number are meant to be trailblazers as opposed to followers.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_78-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They can develop confidence through independent and decisive action and through owning their unique qualities," said Siegel.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_80-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2: Balance</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The number two represents highly intuitive types who can effectively build bridges," explained Siegel. "They can typically read people and are gifted with knowing how to reach others. They may have insights and revelations about life that they can share to inspire. They should learn boundaries and how to say no."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>3: Authenticity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In astrology, the third house is all about communication; in numerology, it's not far off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_86-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The number three represents all forms of creative expression, and many who carry this number are naturally talented," suggested Siegel. "This number can give charm and affability to the personality. There can also be talent and healing through writing and public speaking."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Siegel advised three's to learn to express themselves openly and honestly and not suppress uncomfortable emotions.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_90-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>4: Stability</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_91-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pragmatic, sensible, organized? Then, perhaps four is your Natural Ability number.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The number four is the practical builder who puts things together and gets it done," explained Siegel. "They are logistical problem solvers who have an analytical mind that is geared for strategy and putting the plan together."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_95-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's important for four's not to overwork, stress themselves out, or brush their emotions under the rug.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_97-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>5: Freedom</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_98-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're an adventurous, spontaneous risk-taker (think&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fire sign energy)</a>, you could be a five.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_100-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The number five is the most free spirit of all numbers," said Siegel. "They have a love for travel and are typically restless."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_102-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Five's are strong communicators who typically excel at sales, marketing, branding, or anything within the communication industry.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_104-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They have concerns about being trapped which can complicate relationships and cause a high turnover rate in [their] career," explained Siegel. "They should have enough risk and excitement in what they do so as not to blame others for being imprisoned."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_106-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>6: Acceptance</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_107-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like the sixth house in astrology, which is ruled by service-oriented and super-communicative&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Virgo</a>, the number six is found in the charts of both artists and those in service.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_109-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The artist types may work in design, beauty, fine arts, aesthetics, music, etc.," said Siegel. "The service types may work in therapeutic channels, social service, healing modalities, community help, etc. They have a deep and committed form of love to give and love their partners and family unconditionally."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_111-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, people who carry six might struggle with self-acceptance and find it tough to accept love from others.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_113-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They can also judge themselves too harshly, which can occasionally leak out towards others," suggested Siegel. "They should learn to love themselves in the same way they do others and know they are enough as is."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_115-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>7: Truth</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_116-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The number seven rules knowledge and truth," explained Siegel. It is a mysterious number that promotes a deep curiosity. When this number is prominent, the person's natural intelligence will promote specialization in a field or becoming an expert in what they do. It can bring a bit of the brilliant nerd mind with a knack for research. Some may be skeptics, however, others may tap into spiritual gifts."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_118-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Seven's are teachers, trainers, advisors, and consultants.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_120-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Many find it difficult to trust others and may have experienced betrayals from their past," noted Siegel.

"Those who carry this number seem to attract both positions of authority as well as higher salaries. They have business acumen and are natural managers or executives. Many have a love/hate relationship with money and power."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_125-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their journey is about tapping into whatever truly motivates them and attaining internal self-worth.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_127-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It is important they work not for status but enjoyment as well," Siegel added.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_129-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>9: Surrender</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_130-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The number nine is the last single digit of numbers and represents a completion," explained Siegel.

Many also work with the public or masses."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_132-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nine's need to watch out for getting drained by people in need — energy vampires, if you will — and practice healthy detachment.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_134-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They may be called to let go of certain attachments in life to keep them on their path for humanity," noted Siegel.
