Looking back to the 1950s to the 1960s, you can see the gradual evolution from family comedies like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leave It to Beaver </a>or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Donna Reed Show</a> to lighter fantasy fare like Bewitched and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I Dream of Jeannie</a> to so-called rural comedies such as The Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction or the silliness of Get Smart and F Troop.</p><p>But in the early 1970s — led by CBS, soon to be followed by the other networks —&nbsp;there was a desire for something edgier that would appeal to younger audiences rather than what was perceived to be middle America. The result was the so-called “rural page” that saw the demise — despite continuing popularity — of shows like Mayberry RFD, Green Acres, the aforementioned <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Beverly Hillbillies</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Petticoat Junction</a>, The Red Skelton Show, The Jackie Gleason Show and The Ed Sullivan Show.</p><p>It was a shocking move at the time, but the changing landscape of 1970s TV sitcoms brought viewers series like All in the Family, M*A*S*H, The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Bob Newhart Show (all which were aired with The Carol Burnett Show on Saturday nights, making it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the best night of TV ever</a>). As you’ll see from the extensive guide that follows, they charted the way for a wide number of shows that would fill out the decade and, to be sure, there were still plenty of shows simply going for the laughs and others that attempted to do so, but … well, in this case there were no gold stars for trying.</p><p><strong>MUST READ: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">1950s TV Sitcoms — 40 Classic (and Not So Classic) Shows, and Where to Stream Them!</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1-5.

Andy Griffith, who had given up The Andy Griffith Show in 1968, from 1970 to 1971 starred in <strong>Headmaster</strong>, which saw him in that role at a California private school. The series follows his interactions with his family, faculty and students. From there he went into <strong>The New Andy Griffith Show</strong>, as Andy Sawyer, mayor of a southern town, but, unfortunately, he couldn’t go home again.</p><p>Danny Thomas came in first with 1970 to 1971’s <strong>Make Room for Grandaddy</strong> (sequel series to his hit Make Room for Daddy), which saw him reprising his role of entertainer Danny Williams, joined by original cast members. Unfortunately, it didn’t work in the same way. He didn’t fare much better with 1976 to 1977’s <strong>The Practice</strong>, playing an old-school physician alongside his doctor son (played by David Spielberg).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/the-jimmy-stewart-show_sryNe2.jpg><p>The only weekly television series that Jame Stewart — who for the first time allowed himself to be referred to as “Jimmy” in the credits — ever starred in was 1971 to 1972’s <strong>The Jimmy Stewart Show</strong>.

Mary, who we last saw as Laura Petrie on&nbsp;The Dick Van Dyke Show, is back as Mary Richards, associate producer at WJM News. Besides representing the next step forward in women’s roles on television, Mary led one of the great ensembles of all time. Lou Grant may hate it, but we’ll say it anyway: she’s got spunk and we love it.

Episodes follow her attempts to get each episode mounted, and then bringing the audience into the episodes themselves. Didn’t work out too well for her, but the following year she would give an intense and stunning performance in Robert Redford’s&nbsp;Ordinary People.</p><p><strong>WHERE TO STREAM/WATCH: </strong>Mary Tyler Moore Show, Hulu; The Mary Tyler Moore Hour not currently available</p><p><strong>MUST READ:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mary Tyler Moore Show Cast: Surprising Facts About the Beloved ’70s Comedy’s Star</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dick Van Dyke Show — Inside Secrets on the Series and Cast</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8.

The 1965 play starred Walter Matthau and Art Carney as Oscar and Felix with Jack Lemmon replacing Carney in the 1968 film. But it’s Jack Klugman and Tony Randall in this series that remains the greatest combination of them all.

This version was somewhat historic in that it was the first sitcom since Amos ‘n’ Andy since the 1950s to feature a largely black cast.
