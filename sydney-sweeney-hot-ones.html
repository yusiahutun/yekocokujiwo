Sweeney asked Evans, referring to the milk provided to help cool down guests' mouths when things get too spicy.</p><p>"It's a stand off.

By wing seven - The Forbidden Fruit - a point in the line up where many before have been drinking milk and crying, Sweeney then wondered out loud: "I'm trying to figure out where am I supposed to taste the spice? I'm really confused right now."</p><p>Evans was shocked ... but then things took a turn as Da Bomb Beyond Insanity entered the picture. The sauce is known to start soft but end rough, and it knocked Sweeney down from her high hot sauce horse in no time.</p><p>The Anyone But You star had been comfortably answering questions about her role as Cassie in Euphoria, her many hobbies and even told a story about an intense wakeboarding accident she had at 12 years-old ... until Da Bomb.</p><p>"That's pretty good, I feel tingly on my lips, that one might have an after affect ... that one's building in my mouth," Sweeney said as her eyes began to water and she wiped her nose. "Yeah, that one's building.</p><p>"Why?!" she then exclaimed, as Evans struggled to hide his glee as he said, "Finally! I was worried!</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"Da Bomb is really bomb! I think they all just waited to kick in all at the same time. Da Bomb unlocked it all," Sweeney insisted, totally losing it at this point.</p><p>Despite the rising heat, neither of them sipped on their drinks ... while Sweeney impressively soldiered on to try "the hottest sauce on Hot Ones," The Last Dab: Xperience, which boasts a whopping 2,693,000 Scoville level.</p><p>Though she could barely form a sentence by the end of the episode, she did it!</p><a id=gallery-link-087479c0-3a6a-4794-8d29-a3d814cf682c class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:087479c0-3a6a-4794-8d29-a3d814cf682c data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:c057d7eb-d312-43ab-a2a3-b9341007f82e data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a3/4by3/2024/01/25/a371a7dea86144e69d7a0fe11ec01ace_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma21fqMalusSyZKyvlZq7psWMoaatZZ%2BjsrR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-pencil-cases-amazon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Best Pencil Cases That You Can Buy on Amazon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./juzhong-zhuang.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>JUZHONG ZHUANG | South China Morning Post</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
