The caption to one of his Instagram post was:</p><p>“Was just watching ‘Life or Something Like it’ AGAIN the other day and now I totally get it. Just because I'm really attractive and only date pro athletes it doesn't mean I'm truly happy. I love my sick car and two homes, but maybe I should date a civilian?”</p><p>There were rumors that Ryen once dated fellow ESPN personality <a href=# rel=noopener>Cari Champion</a> while she was unmarried but the news was never confirmed by any of them.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>It's official...

Ryen previously did commentary for the New England Patriots on WBCN before he was let go because of his personal conflict with John Dennis of WEEI.</p><p>Dennis left a threatening voicemail to Russillo which started a dispute between the two.
