Her voice trembles with desperation. She’s just a soul whose intentions are good, after all. The beauty of this song lies in its accuracy. For there is perhaps nothing more frustrating than when a gap appears between what we mean and what others think we mean, between who we are and who others perceive us to be. If others believe us to have done something we haven’t, or not done something we have... how galling that can be.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The relatable fury which lives within these deficits of understanding is an interesting entry point to the rage of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/a42429586/biggest-revelations-prince-harry-spare-interviews/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prince Harry" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Prince Harry</a>.

If ‘truth’ has become too loaded a word, too heavy with ‘therapy speak’, then let us put it another way. This book is Harry’s call: Oh Lord, please don’t let me be misunderstood.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The desire to be understood is a fundamental human need <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The desire to be understood is, according to psychologist and Relate counsellor Josh Smith, a fundamental human need. “We are pro-social creatures,” he explains. “Studies have long shown that being seen and understood by others, from caregivers like our parents to partners and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a41496150/celebrating-friendships/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=friends class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">friends</a>, is how we thrive. It is also how we make meaning of things in the world – not just in our own heads, but through communication with other people. We are socially constructed.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Harry & Meghan | Official Trailer 2 | Netflix" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/9b0fe637-cea2-47a9-a914-47b96157659b/thumb_1280x720_00002_1671014975_94796.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This can become problematic, and damaging, when our understanding of ourselves is fragmented by what Smith calls "worrying social discourses". By that, he means the ills of our society – from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a35779832/harry-meghan-oprah-interview-uk-racism/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=racism class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">racism</a> to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a35457093/why-ive-given-up-on-talking-to-men-about-sexism/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=sexism class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">sexism</a>. If society mirrors back who we are, but fundamentally misunderstands us because it views us through these damaging filters, it can cause huge psychological issues. “Awful things can arise out of not being seen and understood, from depression and anxiety to isolation and trust issues,” Smith says. “It can begin to feel very risky reaching out to people, because the expectation is that you won't be understood. So, you keep to yourself, you lose faith in others.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Smith also explains that having the world misunderstand you can cause a splitting of your self in two. “We have to almost pretend to be a different version of ourselves, and a ‘true’ self and a ‘false’ self emerges,” he says, adding that verifying true <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/a36404793/is-authenticity-overrated/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=authenticity class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">authenticity</a> is itself a whole other battlefield. “In that situation, you may well crave being seen as your true self, and will seek out communities who accept and understand you, as well as desiring a way to make yourself and your ‘truth’ seen.”</p><img alt="prince harry and meghan" title="prince harry and meghan" width=3974 height=2649 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1671010684.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Chris Jackson</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Speaking ones truth is an art,” says psychologist Natasha Tiwari. “It is important that we stand firm in our emotions and thoughts, and that we share what’s in our hearts with others. Speaking one’s truth is also vitally important for communicating what we need with those around us; when we are not truthful, we risk being inauthentic, which serves no one.” Yet Tiwari recognises that expressing this vital human need has been warped in the age of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a39323498/trauma-social-media-empathy/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="social media" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">social media</a>, where myriad ‘truths’ threaten to drown each other out in a cacophony of online voices.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>When we are not truthful, we risk being inauthentic, which serves no one<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think it has opened up a new trend where people increasingly often 'share their truth' with little filter, and without thought to whom they may hurt with their words,” she says. “Sharing one’s truth is best done when the speaker considers their intention and, as such, is more cognisant of the best way to deliver what’s on their mind. When spoken in this way, the speaker is more likely to share with grace, and also find the connection they are hoping for.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In light of this, she offers her own advice for anyone seeking to tell their version of events without a multi-million-pound book deal. “If you’re not sure if you’re in the right place to share your truth gracefully, and to get the result you intend, first share your thoughts with someone you trust – someone who has your best interests at heart, but is also removed enough from your scenario that they won't have any incentive to encourage you to behave in a way that may not support your best outcome,” she says. “It may even be that in having even just one safe space to share the truth of your heart and mind, you’re able to find some peace and the connection you were craving.”</p><img alt="prince harry and william" title="prince harry and william" width=927 height=723 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-prince-william-duke-of-news-photo-1673597911.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Max Mumby/Indigo</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Harry’s ‘truth’ has become controversial because, of course, he is not explaining himself in a vacuum. His truth has come at the expense of others and, in so doing, he has perhaps robbed others of theirs, has perhaps misunderstood them. Once we start down this path, it all becomes knotted. For truth has become a slippery thing in our modern world. Post-truth, my truth, your truth, whose truth is it anyway? We could get even more burdened down with philosophical musings once we place our identities within this paradigm. How much is our sense of self defined by us, how much by others? After all, is Harry our Harry or his?

In making ourselves understood, this can be an attempt to carve out our own identity in spite of that. “It’s tempting to spend a lot of time thinking about what other people think about us, and not a lot of time thinking about us, as ourselves. It takes an incredibly secure person to say, 'I am who I am, I don’t care what you think'. That’s not always how we naturally operate as humans.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is magnified once a person is a celebrity. The misplaced ownership we have over famous people, especially those as knitted into the framework of our society as the royals, means that this parasocial relationship construes its own ‘truth’ about who this person is. Many feel Harry has betrayed our conception of him, by speaking out against the very thing we viewed him as a bastion of. The British public may never forgive him for that. But, I return to Nina Simone's lyrical plea. What has he done, really, except express this fundamental human need to be understood? He has merely removed his identity from our grasp, and taken it back for himself.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwr9Slq66qlWSwtrjTrqmeZZ6axLR7wG1pbW1pa4Zxe9ahsGacn2LEpnnNnpydZaSkerS0wKucZqyiqsGpew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chinese-regional-cuisine-shaanxi-food-noodles-galore-and-best.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chinese regional cuisine: Shaanxi food, with noodles galore, and the best places in Hong Kong to eat</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./transport-services-between-hong-kong-and-macau-return-some-question-casino-hubs-reopening-amid.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Transport services between Hong Kong and Macau to return, but some question casino hubs reopening</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
