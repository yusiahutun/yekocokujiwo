Angie's parents had gone separate ways and her mother, Diana Housman, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married Ronald Bone</a>. The family enjoyed a close-knit relationship with their daughter, a fourth-grader at Buder Elementary School.</p><h2>What happened to Angie Housman?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d7cbb9e440b37ced.jpg><p class=align-left>Every day after school, Angie would walk home from the drop-off point, accompanied by her friends. Two parents would watch the kids walk home on St. Anne Street. On November 18, 1993, Angie got off the bus and started her walk home.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, the parents who watched the kids were busy that day. Housman had to walk past eight houses before getting home. However, Angie's friends had their eyes on her until she got past the fourth house, after which she mysteriously disappeared.</p><p class=align-left>Half an hour later, the fourth-grader was yet to arrive home. Angie Housman's parents left the house and searched for her in the neighbourhood. At first, they assumed she might be chatting with her friends because she was very talkative and social. However, there was no trace of the girl, and they reported her missing, and police launched investigations into her case.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/33f97f22390860f3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Kathy Woodhouse? Story, trial, arrests</span></p></a><h2>Lost and found</h2><p class=align-left>Hours turned to days, and police questioned Angie's friends and family. Unfortunately, the little girl was nowhere to be found. The FBI and Major Case Squad came in to assist with the investigations.</p><p class=align-left>In addition, the public in the St. Louis area continued to tip the police. One week before Housman's disappearance, there was an attempted kidnapping nearby. Thankfully, the victim was able to escape. Police received a sketch of the male suspect who drove a blue car. Unfortunately, the hints did not help to solve Angie's case.</p><p class=align-left>On November 29, 1993, nine days after Marie went missing, a huntsman found her lifeless body nude and tied to a tree in the August Busch Wildlife area. Her wrists were handcuffed, and duct tape covered her face, leaving her nose exposed. With this new development, police turned the missing person case into a homicide investigation.</p><p class=align-left>An autopsy revealed that the nine-year-old had been brutalized and died from hypothermia from exposure to the cold. Angie Housman's injuries included <a id=https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/investigations/new-details-emerge-in-angie-housman-murder-case/63-618251645 href=# rel="nofollow noopener">deep cuts</a> on her wrists and her thigh. Her hair was also cut short and coloured.

For years, investigations continued, but the offender was never pinned down. Unfortunately, Angie Housman's mother succumbed to cancer in 2016 before her daughter's case was resolved.</p><p class=align-left>In 2018, police in St. Charles County revived Housman's case. In 2019, authorities tested all the evidence from the crime scene, including Angie Marie's underwear. The advanced technology helped investigators identify Earl Cox, who was in federal custody, as the child's murderer.</p><p class=align-left>Earl was a former worker of the American Air Force. He worked as a computer operator in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1982, Cox <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was tried</a> for sexually abusing girls below 11 years. He was dishonourably discharged and sentenced to eight years before being paroled in 1985 and returning to St. Louis.</p><p class=align-left>Earl said he was driving to his sister's house when his car encountered a mechanical issue. He stopped to examine it when little Angie walked by. He asked her if she was hungry, and she responded in the affirmative. Once she got into his truck, Angie Housman and Earl Cox drove to BurgerKing, and he took her to his place after buying her food.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e73516720b7091f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Karyn Slover's tragic murder story: What really happened?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After the unfortunate incident, Cox stayed in St. Louis until 1995 before moving to Colorado, where he started a child sex ring. He was arrested in 2002 when an FBI agent posing as a teenager contacted him. He sent her money for a train ticket to Colorado. Instead, the agent arrested him at the restaurant where they had agreed to meet.</p><h2>Where is Earl Cox today?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9ea6bd3c398be51f.png><p class=align-left>Cox was to be released in October 2012. However, a judge established that he was sexually dangerous and civilly committed him under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. He remained here until 2019 when he was convicted of the rape and murder of Housman.</p><p class=align-left>In August 2020, 25 years later, justice finally prevailed for Angie Housman's family. Earl was sentenced to life without parole. In March 2021, he pleaded guilty to sodomy to another young female victim, which saw him receive additional time. He is housed at Southeast Correctional Center in Charleston, Missouri.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c7bcf83d293f0f75.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Seth Wrinkles story: what happened to Eric Wrinkles son?</span></p></a><h2>Quick facts about Angie Marie Housman</h2><li>When was Angie born?
