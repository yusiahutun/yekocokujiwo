I sat down and she spread the deck of cards out in a U-shape, face down, on the table in front of me. I pulled 10 cards, each of which represented a different element of my life – for example I pulled a card for my past, a card for my future, a card for my hopes and fears etc.</p><p id=ec7elWc84F7W data-wc=16><strong>&nbsp;<span style=font-weight:bolder;font-family:Montserrat,sans-serif;font-size:15px;background-color:initial>MOST READ:</span><span style=font-weight:bolder;font-family:Montserrat,sans-serif;font-size:15px;background-color:initial>&nbsp;</span><a class=hm-link href=#>'I cried myself to sleep every night – until I tried this simple trick'</a></strong></p><p id=e57a-54mNBdC data-wc=39>This initial selection of cards was used by Annabelle to create an overall impression of me, before digging into more specific questions/readings. If I arrived with any doubts about the accuracy of the reading – they were quickly diminished.</p><p id=eW9o4_UndTSr data-wc=69>Within minutes, Annabelle had identified that I was at a crossroads in my life, overwhelmed with decisions and bogged down by the practical matters of life – all of which were holding me back and preventing change. I won’t tell you all my secrets, but I can confirm that the cards were read with such precision and detail, it was hard not to be taken aback by the accuracy.</p><p id=ekw1ZuEj5bef data-wc=19>The initial reading enabled me to start to trust the process and lean into whichever direction the reading took.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/37f519befff0-hiking-hattie.jpg><p id=e0koLD1tZuQH data-wc=47>We moved on to the breakup, and I pulled cards for myself, my ex-partner, our relationship, past and future. Through the cards I picked, Annabelle described the relationship with such precision it was as if she had been a fly-on-the-wall for every moment we had spent together.</p><p id=eRQ5ocXba8-L data-wc=35>It truly was extraordinary. Our situation was by no means ‘normal’, so no generic readings would have worked.

Annabelle had also mentioned that at the very end of March, something or someone would come into my life, and that that opportunity/person would lead me to make a huge change in my life and move abroad.</p><p id=edyRO6k4wUUa data-wc=14><strong>&nbsp;DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>What are limiting beliefs and why are they stopping you from feeling happy?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eupoorS4UsgS data-wc=61>She didn’t say where she thought that might be, but I had dismissed that part as it didn’t feel like an option for me, nor was it something I was particularly interested in.

Sessions will encourage you to self-reflect, as you are guided towards the discomfort and able to ask yourself questions you might have previously avoided. There is certainly a spiritual component to tarot cards, but I believe you can take what you need from a session, and if you just come away with a shift in your perspective then that is a wonderful thing.</p><p id=eZ2VlOJMHCNb data-wc=21></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
