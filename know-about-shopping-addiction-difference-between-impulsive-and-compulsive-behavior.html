These are mentioned below:<br></strong><span><strong>Phase 1-&nbsp;</strong></span>People start to have a feeling of anxiety and depression which leads to them doing compulsive Shopping.<br><span><strong>Phase 2-&nbsp;</strong></span>The consumer then shops in order to get an <a href=#>emotional </a>lift to overcome the feeling of anxiety and depression.<br><span><strong>Phase 3-&nbsp;</strong></span>While shopping the only thing matters is to shop and not other factors like the cost of the valuables or the amount of money being spent on shopping.<br><span><strong>Phase 4-&nbsp;</strong></span>Once the consumer is satisfied with their buying now they become conscious about how much money they have spent and what things they have purchased, they even purchase things that are not even required by them at all.<br><span><strong>Phase 5-&nbsp;</strong></span>This leads to a buildup of feelings of guilt and shame in the consumer.<br><span><strong>Phase 6-&nbsp;</strong></span>This buildup of negative feelings again causes depression and Anxiety in the consumer and hence the consumer again starts shopping in order to get an emotional lift.<strong><span><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.psychologs.com/laravel-filemanager/photos/3358/Shopping-2nd.jpg alt width=1200 height=800 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br>Signs of compulsive buying</span><br></strong><span><strong>1.
