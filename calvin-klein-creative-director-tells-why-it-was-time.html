"We've started using a lot of imported Italian fabrics, a lot of Japanese fabrics - and I wanted to take the brand up; I wanted to elevate."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brand has indeed changed since its cult-making heyday. For starters, operations have expanded massively. In Asia, Carrigan says, the label has grown to more than 200 stores in nine years. Quantities sold have also risen rapidly, lowering production costs and allowing Carrigan to indulge in higher qualities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"There has always been a conscious effort to give the customer great designs at a great price for us. And the smaller number of stores you have, the harder it is to get production at a certain level or price. Now that we are in 200 stores, we can have elevated fabrics and give the consumer something like this cashmere at a good price, because of the larger quantities," he says, touching the alpaca cashmere sweater he has on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The change is meant to update the brand "to be in tune with the next generation" without leaving old fans behind. Even though the CK motif will remain, store fronts and the labelling will change to a platinum colour from spring-summer 2014.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the show, held on October 24, top models such as Liu Wen, Soo Joo Park, Yumi Lambert and Zhao Lei were flown in for the catwalk. The clothes reflected a cool minimalism with plenty of platinum colours to reflect the new name. Silhouettes were modern, easy and low-waisted, with materials like silk cotton reverse twill on androgynous lapel jackets. Bonded bomber jackets and fine jersey also made a play for basic separates on men and women, whereas short, young fitted suiting reigned for men. And for the ladies, it was pleated panel dresses and skirts, textured raffia. Sophisticated satin asymmetrical tank dresses during the finale nailed it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of course, minimalism is nothing new for Calvin Klein, or for Carrigan, who studied at the Royal College of Art in London.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I've never liked art nouveau, and I don't like a lot of patterns and swirls … even before I worked at MaxMara and Nicole Farhi, and they are both houses that stood for the minimal and really dressing people."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">With the new label, "I am going for minimalism for a new tribe. Some of the fabrics I'm using are quite new. I've been at Calvin for 15 years, so I wanted to show how you can play with these codes, and then mash them up again. It's like music, isn't it? With sampling and mashing and mixing."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This juxtaposed aesthetic for the Platinum label features a mixture of "very noble, pure Italian fabrics", combined with new technologies. Since the label has always concerned itself with what is new, fresh and modern, it's no wonder that they are also pushing the digital side, and the new way that young customers interact with fashion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I'm not just speaking to the fashion elite, I'm speaking to real people," he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I'm always aware. I write a lot; I like words," he says, and these often become the starting point of his creative expression that ends in collections and campaigns. It was words like "digital re-coding" and also "touched by hand" that pepper his consciousness and speech when he discusses the relaunch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Carrigan sees his role not only as a designer, but as "kind of being an anthropologist/architect/industrial designer" in how he is helping the label transition into this new chapter. And with social media and modern connectivity, "everyone will be part of it literally in one minute", he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Back in the day, it was much more word of mouth - today it's instant."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The game has changed in more ways than one. The brand registered US$7.6 billion in global retail sales last year, with expected growth of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent by 2016, according to company figures online.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then there's also the fact that the brand has gone from being privately owned to publicly owned. With the growing abundance of stores in Asia, as well as a rising global fan base, the message must not get lost in translation for the newly named Calvin Klein Platinum Label.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In short, it's a very good start - but now the pressure is on.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Platinum</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlp5bBpLTErGaaqqSesK2xjmpqbW1kZYZwr8ClraKmXaC5prXNZpqrnZGptrexjJ2gq52TqbyzedOeo6WrXay1unnIrWSwmaNiwaq5xA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./caroline-fleming-husband-boyfriend-net-worth-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Caroline Fleming Husband &amp;amp; Divorce Details, Who Is Her Boyfriend Now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./8-enigmatic-facts-about-mesh-web-spider.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>8 Enigmatic Facts About Mesh Web Spider</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
