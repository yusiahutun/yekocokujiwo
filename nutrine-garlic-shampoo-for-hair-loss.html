Yup, you heard that right. The vegetable you peel, mince, and throw into your cooking can help with <a href=# id=auto-tag_hair-loss data-tag=hair-loss>hair loss</a> and thinning. One such product to start your garlic hair journey is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Nutrine’s Garlic Shampoo For Excessive Hair Loss</a>, and I’m here to explain how.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=garlic-oil-benefits-for-hair>Garlic Oil Benefits For Hair</h2><p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>this study</a>, garlic essential oil is chock-full of sulfuric compounds that are hypotensive, antitumor, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory. They’re even good for hair growth! To put those big, scientific words into layman’s terms, garlic’s antimicrobial properties help destroy fungi and bacteria, which have the potential to cause damage and prevent hair growth. Not only that, but garlic is packed with vitamin C, which is known to promote hair growth and collagen production. Lastly, garlic contains selenium, which boosts blood circulation to hair follicles, resulting in increased nourishment. And when your hair is healthy and nourished, it’s easier to see growth.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=does-garlic-oil-grow-hair><strong>Does garlic oil grow hair?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Everyone reacts differently to certain ingredients, especially when it comes to ones related to hair growth.

It could dry your hair at the beginning but eventually, your hair gets used to it and you’ll gain your natural shine back.”</p><p>If you’re worried about your strands reeking of garlic, let this shopper reassure you: “After using it for a couple of weeks, there were definitely fewer hairs in my brush after shampooing and my hair seemed to be thicker. I now use it a few times a week. <a data-pmc-sp-product=ccb4cd610d3655fae5c7ce99ebe1554c href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"It does not smell like garlic at all","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Nutrine Garlic Shampoo 16 oz.

The smell is kind of soft, like baby lotion.”</p><p>“But O my word this stuff is a lifesaver. I continue to use it after two years. This helps make my scalp feel clean, it helps with that build up from regular shampoo. While I was also taking large quantities of biotin and collagen at the time, I believe this was the final touch that helped (and continues to help) with getting my hair back,” another user commented.&nbsp;</p><p>So, basically what I’m hearing is that shoppers who put this garlic shampoo to the test actually saw results in terms of hair growth and thinning.
