"We ask you to please respect the family‚Äôs wish for privacy as they mourn the loss of their beloved son and brother."</p><p>Perdomo -- who was born in Los Angeles and raised in Southhampton, England -- rose to fame on the Netflix series the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, in which he played Ambrose Spellman, the cousin of <a href=#><strong>Kiernan Shipka's</strong></a> Sabrina. He went on to star as Landon in the After franchise films: After We Fell, After Ever Happy, and After Everything.</p><p>Perdomo further gained popularity when he starred as Andre Anderson on The Boys spinoff, Gen V, which was released last year on Prime Video.</p><p>The producers of Gen V released a statement following Perdomo's passing.</p><p>"We can't quite wrap our heads around this. For those of us who knew him and worked with him, Chance was always charming and smiling, an enthusiastic force of nature, an incredibly talented performer, and more than anything else, just a very kind, lovely person," the producers said in a statement. "Even writing about him in the past tense doesn‚Äôt make sense. We are so sorry for Chance‚Äôs family, and we are grieving the loss of our friend and colleague. Hug your loved ones tonight."</p><p>Amazon MGM Studios and Sony Pictures Television also issued a statement that read: "The entire Gen V family is devastated by the sudden passing of Chance Perdomo. Amazon MGM Studios and Sony Pictures Television extend our heartfelt thoughts and support to Chance's family and all who loved him at this difficult time."</p><p>According to TheWrap, Gen V had yet to start shooting Season 2.

Besides being one of the most talented young actors I‚Äôve ever had the privilege to work with, @chance_perdomo was, truly, a light," Aguirre-Sacasa began. "A generous, funny, open-hearted, wildly intelligent, and fiercely complex and soulful human being. The loss is heartbreaking and staggering. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones."</p><p>"Oh, how I wish Aunt Zelda‚Äôs words were true today (and maybe they are): 'There is no true death for witches, only transformation,'" he continued, before concluding, "Rest in peace, Chance. We all loved you so, so much, friend. P.S. This first picture is from Day One of shooting the 'Sabrina' pilot (I believe). He‚Äôd either just played (or was about to play) a practical joke on Kiernan. It‚Äôs how I always picture Chance. üíîüíßü•∫‚òÅÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è."</p><p>Lucy Davis, who portrayed Hilda Spellman on Sabrina, took to her <a href=#><strong>Instagram</strong></a> with a heartfelt message. "This isn‚Äôt believable to me. I saw Chance just before Christmas and, as usual, he had a beaming smile on his face, and was so happy with the work he was doing on Gen V," she wrote. "Playing his aunt on sabrina was like I had a brother on set with me. He was so cheeky and joined me in all the prank playing. And although we laughed a lot, you could have really deep and soulful conversations with Chance."</p><p>"Wise beyond his years. He was so warm and funny and good," she added. "I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm writing in the past tense. So many of us Sabrina cast and crew have been talking and texting, confused and in shock by the suddenness of his loss. I can‚Äôt even imagine what his family are going through. My heart breaks for them. RIP beautiful Chance.
