During an interview with Big Boy’s Neighborhood, the Detroit, Michigan rapper explained that he has no ill will towards Drizzy for biting his flow – but insisting that he’s the true originator of the style.</p><p>“Drake is my homie. He gave me a lot of credit, because I came up with rhyme scheme a lot of people thought that he came up with,” he said. “I called it ‘Supa Dupa Flow,’ but he kind of made it more popular on the song <a href=#>‘Forever’</a><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.hiphopdx.com/play_button_article_blk.gif border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a> with him, <a href=#>Wayne</a> and Drake, it was kind of the one-word punchline. I did that on my second mixtape I released in ’09 where I was like, ‘I’m supa dupa troopa/Used to the bottom scoopa.’ I just gave them line after line after line of barcode. He kind of took that and used it on his track. A lot of people thought he did it. The thing is, he gave me credit for it like a real G.”</p><p>The <a href=#>G.O.O.D. Music</a> signee watched as the rap game took the flow and turned it into a trend. “It’s crazy because the whole rap game did it, so I was sitting back,” he said. “At first, I was like, ‘Man, this crazy! Everybody doing this!’ But then I thought about it and I was like, that’s not the way to be. You gotta keep it G, man. G’s don’t get mad. G’s is like, that’s what it is. They congratulate you. I changed the game, so I’ma keep changing the game. It is what it is.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Sean admits that he’s still cool with the <a href=#>Young Money</a> rapper and that their friendship came as a surprise. “I just talked to Drake a couple days ago, he’s a good dude. He was wishing me all the best. It’s just tight that people in hip-hop can really be cool like that.”</p><p class=question><strong>RELATED:</strong><a href=#>Big Sean and Chris Brown’s “My Last” Causes Legal Controversy</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZhaoR1gY6toK2klWOvqrOMrJyapl2ovaatyqxkqKZdmb%2Bit8RmmaKsmaO0brTIrGSroKmism6%2F07Kjng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fishing-day-fun-with-reel-can-cooler.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fishing Day Fun with Reel Can Cooler</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kashdami.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Rapper Kashdami?
