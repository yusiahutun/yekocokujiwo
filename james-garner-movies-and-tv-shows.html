When he passed away in 2014 at the age of 86, saddened fans and colleagues were quick to sing his praises. “There are few people on this planet I have adored as much as Jimmy Garner,” said <a href=#>Sally Field</a>, his costar in 1985’s Murphy’s Romance. “I cherish every moment I spent with him and relive them over and over in my head. He was a diamond.” Throughout his 55-plus year career, he truly shined like a diamond in the many James Garner movies and TV shows he appeared in, though the humble actor from Oklahoma — who won <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two Purple Hearts</a> for his service with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Army National Guard</a> during the Korean War — was never one to seek accolades.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s not something that I wanted to achieve, being famous.</a> That never entered my mind. I was just trying to make a living,” he once shared during an interview with the Television Academy Foundation.</p><p>Still, his Hollywood success was the reward for the years he toiled away at a long list of demanding jobs that didn’t ignite his passion. “I worked the oil fields, I drove trucks, I worked in grocery stores, chicken hatcheries, worked with the telephone company, did a little bit of everything and never found a job I really liked, until I finally got into acting. And it took me about two-and-a-half, three years before I liked that,” he revealed in a chat with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Turner Classic Movies</a>.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, I’m a maverick. Always been. Which is a bit of a rebel,” he said of himself, and in Hollywood, that also meant spending his life with the one and only woman he ever married, Lois Clark. Their daughter, Gigi, said that her father was not only dedicated and loyal to his family, but also to his career.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">For him it wasn’t about the money or the awards. He loved to work; that was his thing.</a> Whatever it was, he was the first one there in the morning,” she shared with Closer Weekly, noting that action roles always held a little something special to the daredevil in him. “Like when he did Grand Prix, he got to do all the driving, He actually learned to be a race car driver and even did his own stunts, like when he caught on fire and things like that,” she noted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/2-10.jpg><p>“Comedy, drama. Movies and TV movies. [He] did series when it wasn’t cool and made them iconic,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Lowe</a> said of “James Garner: my hero” upon the legend’s passing. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Mantegna</a>, who starred with Garner in the short-lived TV series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">First Monday</a> in 2002, said, “Working him was the highlight of my life.”</p><p>Known for his classic good looks, strong work ethic, and his ability to appeal to both male and female audiences, Garner also had a naturally stealthy sense of humor and humility that he incorporated into many of his roles in James Garner movies and TV shows. “I don’t do horror films,” he once joked after being asked if he’d ever do a nude scene. He also once quipped of his aversion to doing interviews, “I don’t think I’m that interesting,” though his legions of fans would surely disagree.</p><p>Read on to find out about the James Garner movies and TV shows that those fans, including us, can’t seem to get enough of.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>James Garner TV Shows</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Maverick (1957 to 1962)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/1-11.jpg><p>“Maverick didn’t want a gunfight.… He was the reluctant hero, and that really gave us room to poke fun at all the others,” Garner said of his iconic hit series, which eventually became so popular that his sly and witty professional gambler went on to best its tough competition — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ed Sullivan Show</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Steve Allen Show</a> — in the ratings. A TV movie, 1978’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New Maverick</a>, and another short-lived series, 1981’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bret Maverick</a>, followed, as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a big-screen version starring Mel Gibson</a>. Garner appeared a marshal who is revealed to be Bret’s father.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nichols (1971)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/2-11.jpg><p>“That’s one of my favorites,” Garner said of this one-season series, citing its writing as being top-notch. “It was about a sheriff at the turn of the century when there were no more gunfighters.… A little dinky town, he rode a motorcycle.” It was very funny, he added, “and people loved it, but they canceled it.… and the next year they didn’t have one show on the air that had those kinds of ratings.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Rockford Files (1974 to 1980)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/3-9.jpg><p>“This is Jim Rockford. At the tone, leave your name and message. I’ll get back to you.” The actor won an Emmy in 1977 for his star turn in this hugely popular series about a street-smart P.I. who lives in a Malibu trailer. “The Rockford Files is a terrific show done with style, wit and intelligence. James Garner is equally terrific in the part…and it is his performance that is largely responsible for the success of this show,” The Hollywood Reporter raved during its first season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Polaroid commercials (late 70s to early 80s)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Garner proved his universal appeal in a series of high-profile commercials for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Polaroid</a> cameras and film. “They were quite good,” he humbly noted of the spots he did with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mariette Hartley</a>. “I didn’t need money,” the actor, already a hit on TV and in films, said. “[But] <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Laurence Olivier</a> was doing commercials, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Wayne</a> did commercials. If they could do them, I could do them,” he figured. Bonus points: He stood up for and pushed for Hartley to get a better deal than she was initially getting for her part in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">successful spots</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Decoration Day (1990)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>As a grumpy, retired judge who helps get to the bottom of why his estranged childhood friend won’t accept a World War II Medal of Honor, Garner earned a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV. “A lot of my characters are curmudgeons,” the actor admitted.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Barbarians at the Gate (1993)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>More Golden Globe success came Garner’s way thanks to this TV movie, for which he won Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV. He starred as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">F. Ross Johnson</a> in the biographical dramatization of the former president and CEO of RJR Nabisco who tried to buy the company.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Streets of Laredo (1995)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>In this hit miniseries sequel to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Larry McMurtry</a>’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lonesome Dove</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sissy Spacek</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Shepard</a> costarred alongside Garner, who plays Capt. Woodrow Call. “If you’ve forgotten that James Garner is one of the finest actors television has ever produced, Laredo will remind you of it,” Entertainment Weekly said of his pitch-perfect performance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8 Simple Rules (2003 to 2005)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>After series star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Ritter</a>’s shocking death, Garner was brought in for some male star power on this ABC sitcom. “He grounded us and added a sense of love. And he was like a big, cuddly bear,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Davidson</a>, who played one of the sitcom’s daughters, said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>James Garner Movies</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sayonara (1957)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marlon Brando</a> headlined this film set during the Korean War, an event the then-young Garner knew plenty about. For his early role as Marine Captain Mike Bailey, Garner was named Most Promising Newcomer at the Golden Globes, while costars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Buttons</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miyoshi Umeki </a>earned Oscars for theirs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Children’s Hour (1961)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“First time I ever cried on screen. Might’ve been the last time,” Garner shared of his role in this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shirley MacLaine</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Audrey Hepburn</a>-led adaptation of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lillian Hellman</a> play. In it, he plays the fiancee of Hepburn’s character, a woman who is accused of having an affair with the friend (MacLaine) with whom she runs a boarding school.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Great Escape (1963)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“Like Brando, he could be a pain in the ass on the set,” Garner wrote in his 2011 memoir, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Garner Files</a>, about film lead <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve McQueen</a>. “Steve wasn’t a bad guy. I think he was just insecure,” added the actor, who plays Flight Lieutenant Bob Hendley, aka the Scrounger, one of the Allied prisoners trying to flee a German camp in this taut World War II adventure drama.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Americanization of Emily (1964)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Garner, as Lt. Commander Charles Madison, is romancing a British beauty (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Andrews</a>) when he’s told he has to set off on a dangerous mission to Normandy in this WWII film, which had its work cut out for itself at theaters, as it came out during the Vietnam War. “Audiences have come around to it, and it’s now a cult favorite and a minor classic. Unfortunately, it hasn’t put war out of style,” Garner wrote in his memoir about the anti-war film, which he frequently cited as his favorite role.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Grand Prix (1966)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“When starring in Grand Prix, the people around F1 said he had the talent to be a pro driver,” praised <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ron Howard</a> upon Garner’s death. “I did all my own driving.… the other actors weren’t so gung ho,” the legend noted of the fun he had working on this Formula One themed racing film, which costarred <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eva Marie Saint</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Victor/Victoria (1982)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“Jim will never know how many times I copied his moves in order to learn how to act like a man,” Julie Andrews wrote of re-teaming with Garner after they’d starred together in The Americanization of Emily. “In Emily, we were young. It was intoxicating stuff — pure fun. Victor/Victoria happened some fifteen years later. We were more secure in ourselves, and there was security in working together.” Rotten Tomatoes promises this “musical gender-bender is sharp, funny and all-round entertaining.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Murphy’s Romance (1985)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>As the titular Murphy, Garner stars as an older pharmacist who proves to be the unlikely love interest of a divorced single mom (Sally Field). “Garner plays this character in more or less his usual acting style, but he has been given such quietly off-beat dialogue by the screenwriters…that he comes across as a true original,” critic Roger Ebert said, and the role earned the legendary actor the one and only Academy Award nomination of his career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Space Cowboys (2000)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“It’s a rare pleasure to watch four terrific actors having the time of their lives,” said Rolling Stone of this film’s out-of-this-world cast. Garner, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clint Eastwood</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tommy Lee Jones</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Sutherland</a> all play retired pilots called back into action to help with a failing satellite. “That was 250 years of ass sitting in front of you. My wife died laughing,” Sutherland quipped to Entertainment Weekly of a scene that showed the veteran actors all getting a medical checkup with their bare backsides facing the camera.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Notebook (2004)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>For his role as Duke in this romantic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicholas Sparks</a> tearjerker, Garner won raves — and audiences’ hearts — as the man who devotedly cares for and reads to the love of his life (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gena Rowlands</a>), who is suffering from Alzheimer’s. “We always said, ‘Gosh, we’ve got to find a picture to do,’ and when this came up, I wasn’t going to pass,” Garner said of his career-long desire to work with Rowlands. He graciously credited the power of the powerful scene in which Duke breaks down crying at the nursing home to his costar, telling The Oklahoman that he was simply reacting to how Rowlands played it. “She’s never given a bad performance,” he raved.</p><p><strong>For more Classic content, keep reading!</strong></p><p><a href=#>Joan Caulfield Movies: 10 of the Charming Actress’ Best Films</a></p><p><a href=#>‘The Little Rascals’ Original Cast: What Happened to the Beloved Ragtag Crew?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2Bfrq6x0maemqqemr9uuc6voJ6rXZa7pXnTr2SsoJ%2BswA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeremy-clarkson-upsets-germans-sparks-complaints-polish-world-war-ii-joke-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeremy Clarkson upsets the Germans and sparks complaints over Polish World War II joke</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lupe-marinez-izzo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Lupe Marinez Izzo dating?
