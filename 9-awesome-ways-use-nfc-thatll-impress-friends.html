Officially, NFC can support distances up to 1.5 inches (3.81 cm) apart, but in practice, it can be up to four inches. In a study, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hermans & Moeniralam recorded</a> that they could extend the range of NFC to 13.4 cm (5.28 inches) by creating their antennas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While physical cables and other <a href=#>wireless technologies like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi</a> are often touted as better methods for device communication, NFC technology can be quite useful. A good and popular example is contactless payments. You might have noticed this if you've purchased in a local store and paid with your phone using Google Pay or Apple Pay.</p><p>Generally, NFC works through interactions between two passive (no power source of its own) or active (with a power source of its own) NFC-compatible devices. The most common example is communication between a device like a smartphone (active) and a readable NFC tag (passive).</p><p>This communication is possible because the reading device, often your smartphone, can generate a radio frequency (RF) field to power the tag.</p><h2 id=nfc-compatibility>NFC Compatibility</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nfc-tag-homekit-featured.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Android devices have supported NFC since the early days of the smartphone, but Apple chose to withhold support on the iPhone. However, when the company unveiled Apple Pay, a contactless payment system enabled by NFC, it began including NFC chips on iPhones.</p><p>Before iOS 11, the company limited its use to Apple Pay. However, iPhone models, from the iPhone 7 and newer running iOS 13 and above, now support contactless payments, the ability to read NFC tags, and the capability to write them.</p><p>Note that the specifications of Android phones vary considerably, so NFC support isn't guaranteed. This is primarily true of the affordable smartphones on the market, as other features are given priority.</p><h2 id=what-you-39-ll-need-to-use-nfc>What You'll Need to Use NFC</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nfc-tag-iphone-scan-featured.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you own an NFC-compatible smartphone, you'll need to purchase some NFC tags before you get going. Many types of NFC tags are available, ranging from affordable in-home tags to expensive industrial-use varieties.</p><p>You'll want to invest in rewritable NFC tags (you can reuse them as much as you want) to make the most of the following NFC applications. Although there is a wide range of available tags, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Timeskey NFC Sticker (10 PCS)</a> is a good option; it offers great value for a small price, can be rewritten, and is easy to place wherever needed.</p><p>You'll also need to download an NFC tag writer app to your smartphone. NFC-enabled iPhones can read tags without additional software, but your experience may vary on Android.</p><p>Many apps on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store can write tags. One of the best options is the NFC TagWriter by NXP; the app is easy to use and available for both mobile platforms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tagwriter-android.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tagwriter-ios.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span><p><strong>Download:</strong> NFC TagWriter by NXP for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=9-cool-ways-to-use-nfc>9 Cool Ways to Use NFC</h2><p>Once you've got a compatible smartphone, rewritable NFC tags, and downloaded a tag-writing app, you can begin experimenting. Here are some NFC uses that you can get started with right away.</p><h3 id=instantly-connect-to-a-wi-fi-or-bluetooth-network>1. Instantly Connect to a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Network</h3><p>Wi-Fi passwords and the Bluetooth pairing process can be lengthy and tedious. However, with NFC tags and an active NFC-compatible device, connecting to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth doesn't have to be cumbersome.</p><p>You can write your Wi-Fi username and password to an NFC tag. Android and iOS support this feature, so tapping the tag will pre-populate Wi-Fi connection details and get you online without fuss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Similarly, you can use NFC TagWriter to store Bluetooth pairing information in an NFC tag and place it near the relevant device. Any time you want to play music or connect your devices via Bluetooth, you'll only have to tap the tag.</p><h3 id=get-yourself-in-and-out-of-bed>2. Get Yourself in and Out of Bed</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/your-sleep-tracker-isn-t-doing-it-s-job.jpg><p>Do you struggle to go to bed? Maybe you end up scrolling on your phone past midnight daily; NFC tags can help. You can write an NFC tag and place it on your nightstand so that it can dim the lights, launch a meditation app, or silence your phone when you tap it. Anything to get you to bed!</p><p>Similarly, waking up in the morning can be a considerable challenge. Don't worry; you can use an NFC tag to motivate you out of bed. Apps like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Sleep As Android</a> integrate alarms with NFC tags through in-app captchas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Use the app to write an NFC-based captcha, then the only way to turn off the alarm is to venture out of bed, find the NFC sticker, and tap your phone against it.</p><h3 id=launch-a-website>3. Launch a Website</h3><p>There might be times when you want to direct someone to a specific website. This can be tricky, especially if it's not a simple website address.</p><p>Instead of having them type out a long random URL, you can write the URL to an NFC tag. When tapped, it loads the user's mobile browser and directs them straight to your desired site.</p><h3 id=make-payments>4. Make Payments</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nfc-terminal-1.jpg><p>As mentioned eNFC enables contactless payments using services like <a href=#>Google Pay, Samsung Pay, or Apple Pay</a>. In many places around the world, contactless payments have become commonplace. Indeed, contactless is the preferred payment method in many convenience and food stores in the US.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Apple Pay and Google Pay allow you to keep track of your spending, analyze your habits, and store coupons. Additionally, opting for NFC payments means you no longer need to carry other payment methods alongside your phone.</p><h3 id=automatically-enter-driving-mode>5. Automatically Enter Driving Mode</h3><p>iPhone users know that when they enter the vehicle and connect to their in-car entertainment system, their phone will automatically enter <strong>Driving Mode</strong>. This silences notifications and optimizes your setup for your journey. Although some Android smartphones can do this, the majority don't.</p><p>You can write the tasks to an NFC tag if you'd prefer to automate this process. When placed inside the car, a phone tap can enable <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong>, turn data on or off, open your navigation app, play music, engage your voice assistants, connect your device to your car's Bluetooth, and optimize your driving experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=automate-common-phone-tasks>6. Automate Common Phone Tasks</h3><p>Android and iOS now have methods of automating regular tasks, but they don't always offer the kind of flexibility you're after. Using NFC, you can set up shortcuts for actions like calling a specific friend or family member, opening your camera, or running your favorite streaming service as you leave the house.</p><p>If you want a more efficient way to automate these shortcuts, consider investing in a set of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DIMPLE Smart Buttons</a>. These physical buttons stick to your smartphone's rear near the NFC chip. They activate a custom NFC task, which you can set via the DIMPLE app when pressed.</p><h3 id=share-media>7. Share Media</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iphones-using-namedrop.jpg><p>If you create videos for YouTube, stream on Twitch, or release music on Spotify, one of the biggest challenges is getting people to see your content. You can overcome this hurdle with NFC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's possible to embed a link to your work on an NFC tag and strategically stick it somewhere to get people interested. Just be sure to explain what is on the tag, as people may be wary of <a href=#>NFC security issues</a>.</p><h3 id=create-an-nfc-business-card>8. Create an NFC Business Card</h3><p>If you've ever been to a conference or networking event, you know how important it is to have a business card. They help you stay in touch with new contacts and remind people who you are and what you do.</p><p>But what if there was a better way to exchange information? With NFC, there is.</p><p>To begin, <a href=#>create a digital business card (you can use Photoshop)</a>. Ensure it contains all your essential information, like your name, title, company, website, email, and social media profiles. After creating the card, generate a QR code or shareable link. If you generate a QR code, you must convert it to a link first.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You'll need an NFC writing app to write this link to an NFC tag. When you're ready to exchange information, have the other person scan the tag with their phone.</p><h3 id=play-pranks>9. Play Pranks</h3><p>Do you want to have fun and impress your friends? You can program an NFC tag to play silly sound effects, change channels randomly, or leave secret messages. Imagine the startled reactions of your friends when they randomly hear chicken sounds or loud bangs.</p><p>And what's more fun is that you can stick NFC tags anywhere—on the TV remote, fridge door, or chairs!</p><h2 id=the-best-uses-for-nfc>The Best Uses for NFC</h2><p>NFC chips have changed the way we interact with the world around us. These cheap electronic components have enabled contactless payment systems, made some physical tickets redundant, and facilitated affordable home automation.</p><p>However, while NFC is undoubtedly useful, it is vulnerable to security issues, like all technology. Before you delve into this wireless technology, you should learn to protect yourself from NFC risks and hacks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fbnqiw8SspqadXayuur%2BMrqqeZZ6bsG7Ax5qrpaRdnrqxvsSsqmaeop6yr7DSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./parents-kept-teen-daughters-home-filled-bags-trash-human-waste-without-power-water-lived-camper-driveway-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alaska parents 'kept teen daughters in home filled with bags of trash and human waste'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-plus-size-womens-winter-coats.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Best Plus Size Women's Winter Coats of 2021</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
