This program lets you remap keys, create custom shortcuts, run macros to automate repetitive tasks, and more.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Let's look at some useful AutoHotkey scripts to get you started, along with the basics of the software so you can make your own.</p><h2 id=how-to-install-autohotkey>How to Install AutoHotkey</h2><p>Before you can use cool AHK scripts or make your own, you'll need to install AutoHotkey on your system.</p><p>Visit <a href=#>AutoHotkey's homepage</a>, click <strong>Download</strong>, and choose <strong>Download Current Version</strong> to grab it. Run through the quick install dialog, and you're ready to start using AutoHotkey scripts.</p><h3 id=how-to-create-new-autohotkey-scripts>How to Create New AutoHotkey Scripts</h3><p>The program you just installed handles the execution of AHK scripts, but it won't do anything until you actually have a script running.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>To create a new AutoHotkey script, right-click anywhere on your desktop (or wherever else is convenient) and choose <strong>New > AutoHotkey Script</strong>. Name it something that makes sense. Then right-click on your new file and choose <strong>Edit Script</strong>, or open the file in your text editor of choice, to start working on it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/New-AutoHotkey-Script.png><p>Note that you can also open your text editor, type up an AutoHotkey script, and save it as a file ending in <strong>.ahk</strong> to achieve the same result. Just make sure it has the right file extension!</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Speaking of this, it's a good idea to upgrade your text editor from the basic Notepad. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Notepad++</a> and <a href=#>Visual Studio Code</a> are both great free options.</p><p>Now that you have the software to run AutoHotkey scripts, you can download scripts that others have written to take advantage of them without doing any work on your own. To save one, simply download it as an <strong>.ahk</strong> file and save it wherever you wish.</p><p>To run a script, simply double-click on it and it will go into effect. However, you'll probably want some of these scripts to run as soon as you boot your computer so you don't have to start them manually every time.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>To do so, copy and paste the <strong>.ahk</strong> files <a href=#>into your Startup folder</a>. You can get there easily by typing <strong>shell:startup</strong> into the Start menu. Otherwise, browse to the following location:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup<br></code></pre><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/AutoHotkey-Script-Startup-Windows.png><p>Doing this loads your AutoHotkey scripts once you log into your computer.</p><h2 id=the-best-autohotkey-scripts-to-try>The Best AutoHotkey Scripts to Try</h2><p>Here are some of the most useful AutoHotkey scripts you can download and use to improve Windows right away. For even more AutoHotkey script examples, including ones that are much more complex than these, check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoHotkey Script Showcase</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=autocorrect>1. AutoCorrect</h3><p>Even with the precision of a desktop keyboard, you're still bound to make mistakes when typing. And while this is an old AHK script, typos don't go out of style.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Enable the Built-In Autocorrect in Windows 10</a></span></p><p>It contains thousands of common misspellings—when you make a mistake, it instantly replaces your error with the correct word. It even allows you to add your own words, which we'll discuss later.</p><p><strong>Download</strong>: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AutoCorrect Script</a></p><h3 id=disable-lock-keys>2. Disable Lock Keys</h3><p>The three Lock keys—Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock—aren't used that often in today's computing. You probably use the number pad solely for digits, only <a href=#>hit Caps Lock by accident</a>, and don't even care about Scroll Lock.</p><p>If you rarely use these modifiers, try setting them to a default value with this script:</p><pre><code class="hljs autohotkey"><span class=hljs-comment>; Set Lock keys permanently</span><br><span class=hljs-built_in>SetNumlockState,</span> AlwaysOn<br><span class=hljs-built_in>SetCapsLockState,</span> AlwaysOff<br><span class=hljs-built_in>SetScrollLockState,</span> AlwaysOff<br><span class=hljs-keyword>return</span><br></code></pre><p>This assumes you want Num Lock always on. If you prefer it off, just change that line (or remove it completely and only change Caps Lock and Scroll Lock).</p><h3 id=re-purpose-caps-lock>3. Re-Purpose Caps Lock</h3><p>Once you've used the above script to disable Caps Lock, it makes sense to give that key another purpose.</p><p>Using this short script will turn Caps Lock into another Shift key, but you can change it to anything you'd like (perhaps another Windows key, if your keyboard only has one of those):</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><pre><code class="hljs autohotkey"><span class=hljs-comment>; Turn Caps Lock into a Shift key</span><br><span class=hljs-title>Capslock::</span>Shift<br><span class=hljs-keyword>return</span><br></code></pre><h3 id=quickly-view-or-hide-hidden-files>4. Quickly View or Hide Hidden Files</h3><p>It's important to know <a href=#>how to view hidden files and folders in Windows</a> at times. If you only need access to hidden folders once in a while and don't want them cluttering up your view normally, this is a useful script.</p><p>This script simply has you press <strong>Ctrl + F2</strong> with File Explorer open to toggle showing hidden files or folders. That's all there is to it! You'll just need to copy the code from the linked forum post into a script:</p><pre><code class="hljs autohotkey"><br><span class=hljs-title> ^F2::</span><span class=hljs-keyword>GoSub</span>,CheckActiveWindow<br><span class=hljs-title> CheckActiveWindow:</span><br> ID := WinExist(<span class=hljs-string>"A"</span>)<br><span class=hljs-built_in> WinGetClass,</span>Class, <span class=hljs-keyword>ahk_id</span> <span class=hljs-variable>%ID%</span><br> WClasses := <span class=hljs-string>"CabinetWClass ExploreWClass"</span><br><span class=hljs-built_in> IfInString,</span> WClasses, <span class=hljs-variable>%Class%</span><br><span class=hljs-built_in> GoSub,</span> Toggle_HiddenFiles_Display<br> <span class=hljs-keyword>Return</span><p><span class=hljs-title> Toggle_HiddenFiles_Display:</span><br> RootKey = HKEY_CURRENT_USER<br> SubKey = Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced</p><p><span class=hljs-built_in> RegRead,</span> HiddenFiles_Status, % RootKey, % SubKey, Hidden</p><p>if HiddenFiles_Status = <span class=hljs-number>2</span><br><span class=hljs-built_in> RegWrite,</span> REG_DWORD, % RootKey, % SubKey, Hidden, <span class=hljs-number>1</span> <br> else <br><span class=hljs-built_in> RegWrite,</span> REG_DWORD, % RootKey, % SubKey, Hidden, <span class=hljs-number>2</span><br><span class=hljs-built_in> PostMessage,</span> <span class=hljs-number>0</span>x111, <span class=hljs-number>41504</span>,,, <span class=hljs-keyword>ahk_id</span> <span class=hljs-variable>%ID%</span><br> <span class=hljs-keyword>Return</span><br></p></code></pre><p><strong>Visit:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toggle Hidden Files Script</a></p><h3 id=quickly-show-or-hide-known-file-extensions>5. Quickly Show or Hide Known File Extensions</h3><p>This one is similar to the above since it deals with File Explorer as well. For security reasons, it's smart to always show file extensions. This makes it easier to spot rogue EXE files masquerading as a PDF, or similar. It's also handy when you need to <a href=#>deal with Windows 10 file associations</a>.</p><p>The below script will let you toggle showing extensions for known file types with <strong>Win + Y</strong>.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toggle Known File Extensions Script</a></p><h3 id=insert-special-characters>6. Insert Special Characters</h3><p>Aside from the few special characters on your keyboard (like @ and *), there are dozens more that aren't so convenient to access. One of the fastest <a href=#>ways to input foreign characters and other uncommon symbols</a> is using AutoHotkey.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>With just a line of AHK code, you can quickly insert these special symbols and stop having to remember ALT codes, or copying and pasting from an online list.</p><p>Use the template below to create shortcuts that are most useful for you. The characters left of the two colons are what you press to trigger the shortcut, while the symbol inside the brackets is what the shortcut inserts.</p><p>So for example, if you want to press <strong>Alt + Q</strong> to insert the trademark icon, you would create a script with this:</p><pre><code class="hljs autohotkey"><span class=hljs-title>!q::</span>SendInput {™}<br></code></pre><p>For reference, the characters for keys are as follows. You can read more about hotkeys on <a href=#>AutoHotkey's guide page</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>^</strong> for <strong>Ctrl</strong></li><li><strong>!</strong> for <strong>Alt</strong></li><li><strong>#</strong> for <strong>Win</strong></li><li><strong>+</strong> for <strong>Shift</strong></li></ul><h3 id=run-a-quick-google-search>7. Run a Quick Google Search</h3><p>If you're a heavy Google searcher, this handy shortcut lets you run a search for any copied text on your computer.</p><p>It will launch your default browser and search Google for any bit of text you have highlighted when you press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + C</strong>. It's handy to reduce copying and pasting all the time!</p><pre><code class="hljs autohotkey"><span class=hljs-title>^+c::</span><br>{<br><span class=hljs-built_in> Send,</span> ^c<br> Sleep <span class=hljs-number>50</span><br><span class=hljs-built_in> Run,</span> https://www.google.com/search?q=<span class=hljs-variable>%clipboard%</span><br> <span class=hljs-keyword>Return</span><br>}<br></code></pre><h3 id=use-the-numpad-as-a-mouse>8. Use the Numpad as a Mouse</h3><p>While you can <a href=#>navigate Windows without a mouse</a> if needed, having this script around means you don't have to remember keyboard shortcuts to do this. This neat AutoHotkey script uses your number pad to act as a mouse, giving you more precision and a way to get around your computer in case of hardware failure.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Have a look at the information at the top of the script for guidance on using it.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Keyboard Numpad as a Mouse Script</a></p><h3 id=launch-any-app>9. Launch Any App</h3><p>The Start menu makes it easy to pull up any program installed on your computer in seconds. But for your most-used programs, you might want an even faster way to launch them.</p><p>The script to open an app is simple; here's one to launch Firefox when you press <strong>Win + F</strong>. Change it as needed for your preferred key combo and app.</p><pre><code class="hljs autohotkey"><span class=hljs-title>#f::</span>Run Firefox<br></code></pre><h3 id=makeshift-volume-keys>10. Makeshift Volume Keys</h3><p>Most keyboards have keys to easily change the volume, change the music track, and similar. But in case yours doesn't have these, you can use AutoHotkey to come up with your own volume buttons.</p><p>Here's one example, which uses <strong>Shift + Plus</strong> and <strong>Shift + Minus</strong> (keys on the number pad) to raise and lower the volume. You can also hit the little-used <strong>Break</strong> key to toggle mute.</p><p>As with the other scripts, feel free to adjust the buttons to your liking.</p><pre><code class="hljs autohotkey"><span class=hljs-title>+NumpadAdd::</span> Send {Volume_Up}<br><span class=hljs-title>+NumpadSub::</span> Send {Volume_Down}<br><span class=hljs-title>break::</span>Send {Volume_Mute}<br><span class=hljs-keyword>return</span></code></pre><h2 id=writing-your-own-scripts>Writing Your Own Scripts</h2><p>If you feel confident, why not try making your own AutoHotkey scripts next? If you're just getting started with AHK, you'll probably benefit the most from text expansion.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Read More: <a href=#>Best Text Expansion Tools for Windows</a></span></p><p>Essentially, text expansion lets you type a small bit of text that automatically expands to something much longer. If you send the same email multiple times per day, or type out your email address all the time when signing into websites, setting up text expansion will make you more productive.</p><p>If you downloaded the AutoCorrect script from #1 above, there's a spot at the bottom for you to add any phrases of your own, which is a perfect place to put some single-line expansion. If you're not using this script, just make a new script for your expansion entries.</p><p>It's simple to do: type two colons, followed by the hotkey text. After two more colons, type the phrase you want the shortcut to expand to. So if you wanted to make typing "@@" auto-expand to your email address, the script would be:</p><pre><code class="hljs autohotkey"><span class=hljs-title>::@@::</span>youremail@domain.com<br></code></pre><p>The possibilities here are many. You could make the hotkey <strong>Ctrl + Alt + C</strong> spit out a canned email that you type several times a day, or any number of other tasks pertinent to your work:</p><pre><code class="hljs autohotkey"><span class=hljs-title>^!c::</span><br>Send Hello,{enter}This is a canned email.<br><span class=hljs-keyword>return</span><br></code></pre><p>Once you've set up some text expansion, you can start remapping keys if you find some of them not useful in their current state.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Do you wish the Insert button was instead a shortcut for Copy, for example? You can change that with the following:</p><pre><code class="hljs autohotkey"><span class=hljs-title>Insert::</span>^c<br></code></pre><p>Check out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the AutoHotkey tutorials</a> for more info. For a more guided introduction to AHK, we have an <a href=#>AutoHotkey guide for beginners</a> you can also check out.</p><h2 id=the-power-of-autohotkey>The Power of AutoHotkey</h2><p>The great part about AutoHotkey is that it's completely customizable for your needs. If you just want auto-correction and a few simple bits of text expansion, you can easily set that up. If you want to go deeper with lots of custom controls and complex shortcuts, you can write any scripts you please.</p><p>With these great AutoHotkey scripts, you don't need any coding experience to get started. For a similar tool, you should also look into the basics of Windows batch files.</p><p>Image Credit: FabrikaSimf/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shutterstock</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fZn1ur86oo2aZpam8qbvTpJyyZaOYv6q806xkppmbmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./funny-christmas-holiday-movies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>65 Best Funny Christmas Movies 2022</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./whos-flying-the-millennium-falcon-in-episode-7-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Whos Flying the Millennium Falcon in Force Awakens?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
