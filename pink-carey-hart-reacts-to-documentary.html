How do you feel about being in it and your parts in it?' I'm like, 'Well, it's a little too late now,'" he joked, before explaining why he was very pleased with the final product.</p><p>"I'm kind of glad I got to show a little bit of my vulnerable side as a father as opposed to ... I'm perceived as being this wild, crazy, motorcycle, tattooed scumbag," he told Ellen. "So it's kind of nice for people to see my softer side."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:15456d27-03de-4338-ac7d-7fe6ffea4a33 data-container-ref=toofab:article:8be79e7f-2b81-414a-af3a-f56d388fd9ff data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f9/5by4/2021/05/21/f949224831c048488e7a13908438e0b7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">P!nk Wishes She Reached Out More to Britney Spears, Talks Turning Down Super Bowl & First GF</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>While he is thrilled with how it came out, he added that he did prank his other half with a last-minute request to "cut out my whole interview part" from the finished film. "The look on her face was pretty amazing," he added.</p><p>As DeGeneres praised their love story, Hart said the two have "grown up together," saying that in their 18 years together, he's been "her muse for about 17 of those" and adding, "I'm quite used to being the punching bag" for her creativity.</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, he also opened up about their daughter Willow's performance with P!nk during the Billboard Music Awards. The 10-year-old not only joined the performance, but participated in her mom's trademark aerial stunts during the jaw-dropping number.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c03ccd4b-bbfe-40e4-bd7b-a672fa27f3bf data-container-ref=toofab:article:8be79e7f-2b81-414a-af3a-f56d388fd9ff data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/65/5by4/2021/05/24/6578311e4bdf42d0826599faa0b38cea_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">2021 Billboard Music Awards: The Most Viral Moments of the Night</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I can't say that I was nervous. Both of my kids are really physically talented. Willow has amazing balance. I was just a little bit more concerned about her commitment to it," Hart told Ellen.</p><p>"My wife had to sit down with her, as well as I did like, 'Look, if you're going to do this, you gotta give it 100%.' Leading up to the performance, they had [an aerial hoop] set up in the house and she gave 100 percent, worked her butt off, no stage fright, wasn't concerned or nervous at all, and absolutely killed it."</p><p>He added that while his two kids are little risk takers, he "can't say I want to see them try to make a career out of motocross" like him. He did say, however, he wants them "to be able to ride motorcycles." Like his kids, he too started riding when he was just 4.</p><p>Watch the full interview below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j29maW9fpbavt4ycmKudqWK1or7TZqmemZOpwG7AzmabqJulorKvwMCrsGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cook-review-leave-the-world-behind-disappoints-at-the-end.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cook review: Leave the World Behind disappoints at the end</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-cherry-jones-dating.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Cherry Jones Dating Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
