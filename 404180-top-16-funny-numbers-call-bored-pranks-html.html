What are the best funny numbers to call, and what messages do they have?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/53d302b45e0254d6.jpg><p class=align-left>We have compiled a list of numbers that will cheer you up, help you avoid nagging people, or help you change the behaviour of those around you.</p><h2>The best funny numbers to call for pranks</h2><p class=align-left>Here is a look at some funny numbers to call when bored.</p><h3>1. Santa's workshop: 1-603-413-4124</h3><p class=align-left>Is it too early to call for a <a href=#>Christmas</a> present? Usually, adults prank kids that Santa gives them gifts on Christmas. The kids then sleep on Christmas Eve, knowing they will receive a surprise gift from him on 25th December.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cf91d41f5ed8c0a4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 mind-blowing tricks to play on friends to fool them</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You may want to try something different this year. Instead of just giving the kids a present, you can prank them by telling them to call Santa directly. By dialling 1-603-413-4124, one can easily believe they are speaking to a real person.</p><p class=align-left>The responses on the other end are automated. Besides kids, you can also give this number to the person who likes to disturb you.</p><h3>2. Divorce hotline: (605)–475–6960</h3><p class=align-left>Have you recently tied the knot or have a friend that is married? If yes, then this is the right number to call for fun. You can swap the contacts of a couple to make one believe their partner is divorcing them.</p><p class=align-left>The most exciting part about this number is the hilarious automated response you will receive when dialling it. Here is a sample response.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d35390401e3bd6fb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best anti-jokes for those who have a dry sense of humour</span></p></a>Are you tired of nagging, infrequent sex, or always being wrong? Do you find yourself apologizing for things you haven't done? Have you ever really questioned where everything in your life went so wrong?<h3>3. Sex addiction intervention: (605)-475-6972</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cf91d41f5ed8c0a4.jpg><p class=align-left>This is one of the best funny fake numbers rated 18+. The hotline number works magic for those people who do not know how to say no to strangers. Any person trying to call the number would probably learn their lesson. The robotic response will leave them regretting pestering you.</p><h3>4. Bad breath hotline: (605)–475–6959</h3><p class=align-left>The bad breath hotline is a hilarious prank call number. It is an ideal way to tell a person with bad breath what they are supposed to do; brushing their teeth regularly, of course.</p><p class=align-left>How can you give someone such a number, though? Telling someone that they have a bad odour is obviously offensive and rude. Instead, you can leave the person an anonymous note with the number for the hilarious yet somehow helpful message on the other end of the call.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79fef1a2cb93b996.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ Zulu proverbs and sayings about love, life, and death</span></p></a><h3>5. The loser line: (206) 569-5829</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike other <a href=#>phone numbers</a> to prank call, you have the freedom to choose the message you want your victim to hear when they 'call you' on the loser line. With this number, you are required to record your voice message. The message you choose to record is entirely up to you. You can also prank your partner or friend and watch their reactions.</p><h3>6. The rejection hotline: (605)–475–6968</h3><p class=align-left>The rejection hotline is among the hilarious prank call numbers to use on someone you do not want to be associated with in life. For instance, those people who do not easily give up. Dialling (605)–475–6968 will give them a hint that you are longer interested in them.</p><p class=align-left>Here is a look at a part of the scripted automated response.</p>Please take the hint and accept the fact that you are rejected. And then get over it. And please do your best to forget the person who gave you this number because, trust us, they already forgot about you.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/19e920c1fb367950.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 scary phone numbers that work and you should never call</span></p></a><h3>7. Stop complaining: 605–475–6973</h3><p class=align-left>Some people complain a lot even when it is not necessary.

Any perpetual complainer on earth will understand the intention of giving them this number, making it one of the most <a href=#>useful and funny</a> numbers to call.</p><h3>8. Keep an idiot entertained: 401-285-2079</h3><p class=align-left>We all have that one friend or relative who is incredibly annoying most of the time. Often, they tend to engage in numerous unruly acts. Since it is offensive and harsh to tell someone about their indecency to their face, why not have them dial 401-285-2079 on their phone?</p><p class=align-left>At first, they may find it entertaining dialling the number, but eventually, they will understand its purpose. It is satisfying knowing that you have pranked someone, at the same time, corrected their bad characters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/582612be59111409.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ cute contact names for your boyfriend in your phone</span></p></a><h3>9. <i>Better Call Saul</i> hotline: 505–503–4455</h3><p class=align-left>If you are a fan of television shows, you have definitely come across <i>Better Call Saul.</i> It is one of the best action series with incredible characters such as Saul Goodman, the star criminal attorney.

You can dial the number to figure out whether you are sober or drunk. The person on the other end will ask you a few questions before generating your sobriety results.</p><h3>11. Outsource friendship: 605–475–6966</h3><p class=align-left>When one thinks of outsourcing, some of the things that come to mind include tasks and repetitive services such as customer care. Can you imagine <a href=#>your friendship</a> being one of these things you can outsource?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs2erjrflimk4g.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best dating sites for black women</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Once you dial this number, a pre-recorded message starts out politely, but by the time you get to the agent's name, you know it's all a prank.
