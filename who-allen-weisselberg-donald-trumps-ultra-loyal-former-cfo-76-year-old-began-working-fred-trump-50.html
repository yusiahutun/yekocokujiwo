Per the publication, Weisselberg helped Trump repay <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">lawyer</span></a> Michael Cohen for a payment made to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. The money was allegedly paid to Daniels (real name Stephanie Clifford) in a bid to cover up her allegations that she’d had an affair with Trump. The payments were falsely labelled as legal costs, per Forbes. Consequently, Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Weisselberg’s long-standing history with the Trumps</strong></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Weisselberg’s history with the Trump family dates back over 50 years. He was first hired by Donald Trump’s father Fred in 1973. Per USA Today, Weisselberg soon became a trusted insider at the Trump Organisation and was asked to manage all of its assets. In the late 1980s, he established the accounting departments for the Trump Organisation, managing both the company and Trump family members’ tax returns. He also managed the finances of the Trump properties.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Weisselberg’s close bond with Trump</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/26/974c30de-4c5f-4406-9d2a-6c4a9a16e4bb_1126e908.jpg>In 1986 he began working directly with Donald Trump, according to USA Today.

According to The New York Times, those who worked with Weisselberg described him as a “soldier”, unflinching in his support for Trump. “Over decades, Mr Weisselberg’s personal and family life became increasingly fused with the company and with Mr Trump, who is just 14 months older,” the newspaper wrote.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">New Republican power couple?
