And this was when he mentions hat they are the only ones who can take matters into their own hands.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>4. "Nothing changed! You haven't changed one bit, damn it! You're still as useless as you ever were! Nothing changed!" - Eren Yeager</strong></h2><p><img alt="Attack on Titan [Crunchyroll, Studio MAPPA]" title="Attack on Titan [Crunchyroll, Studio MAPPA]" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-11/1699378080_attack-on-titan-eren.jpeg></p><p>In the same episode, Eren said the same lines, realizing that nothing would ever change even if they take the strongest of the steps.

Here, Eren emphasizes the importance of perseverance and moving forward in Season 4, Episode 3.</p><h2><strong>7. "I don’t have time to worry if it’s right or wrong, you can’t hope for a horror story with a happy ending!" - Eren Yeager</strong></h2><p><img alt="Attack on Titan [Crunchyroll, Studio MAPPA]" title="Attack on Titan [Crunchyroll, Studio MAPPA]" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-11/1699378895_eren-3.jpeg></p><p>This quote comes from the vault of the anime.

Historia... eat me... and save humanity. It’s all... up to you." - Eren Yeager</strong></h2><p><img alt="Attack on Titan [Crunchyroll, Studio MAPPA]" title="Attack on Titan [Crunchyroll, Studio MAPPA]" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-11/1699380481_eren-a.jpeg></p><p>This quote came at the time when Eren was addressing Historia.
