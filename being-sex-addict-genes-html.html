His first wife divorced him after he said he could not remain faithful and his second wife agreed to turn a blind eye to his 'chance encounters'.</p><p>Halle Berry's ex-husband Eric Benet is also reported to have checked into a clinic to help him overcome his sex addiction.</p><p>Prof Ebstein hopes his study will open up new ways to tackle and treat sexual problems.</p><p>At the same time, it may also provide reassurance for many.</p><p>"If you have a lower sex drive, it does not necessarily mean you should go to see a sex therapist to see if something is wrong with you,' he said.</p><p>"As long as it is not causing a problem in your life, may be you don't have a problem. If it does not bother you or interfere with your life, then maybe you are best to just live with it.</p><p>"After all, if you are not good at music, you don't keep on trying to play the saxophone."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKAeYOWcm9oepWeu6h50p6vZpmUmbakwIygnKedo2O1tbnL</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-ripa-ultracor-leggings.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Ripa Keeps Wearing Flattering Ultracor Leggings</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./barry-minkow-bio-wiki-age-height-net-worth-married.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Barry Minkow Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth &amp;amp; Married</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
