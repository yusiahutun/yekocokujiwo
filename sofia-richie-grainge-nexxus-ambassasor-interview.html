They've been super helpful.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In general, she admits that behind closed doors, she loves to try new things. “I experiment a lot. I'm having fun. I'm just like every other girl trying things and figuring out what works for me,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, Richie Grainge sits down with Bazaar.com to share more about her pregnancy beauty routine, the beauty advice she’s passing down to her daughter, and more.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Your hair color is on many a mood board, including my own. How do you maintain it? Has your routine changed during pregnancy?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">First of all, thank you. I try my hardest to color my hair, but be mindful of using bleach. I do my roots about every four to five months and I connect my highlights to the top of my head. But I go into the hair salon once a month and I tone my overall hair. So that's my little secret routine that I have going just because I just feel like the tone kind of gets off, whether it's from showers or swimming or whatever it may be.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And then with pregnancy, I'm thinking…it honestly hasn't really changed. When I found out I was pregnant, my doctor was like, you're totally fine to [color your hair]. So I've just been doing some golden pieces around the framing of my face to just keep everything connected. I'm not doing a full set of highlights, but I've continued to tone and do those brightening pieces every three to four months.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Your wedding looks were such a phenomenon. What was the inspiration you were going for with your wedding hair?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I kept using the words classic, timeless, and simple. I really didn't want to do too much with my hair or my makeup. I really wanted it to feel clean and timeless and not like it was a ton of effort, which is kind of what I try to do on a day-to-day basis. But especially for my wedding, I really was mindful of, in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 50 years, I want to look back and be like, that was a great idea. So I'm really happy that I went that route just because I feel like I didn't want to go out of my comfort zone on such a special day. And I feel like that's where things can kind of go wrong when you start experimenting. And I wasn't going to experiment on such a large occasion for myself.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>You’ve talked about how your hair stopped growing during COVID and hair masks helped. How did you figure that out?</strong><br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Right before COVID, I was coloring my hair so frequently and my hair was stuck kind of at a collarbone length and I didn't quite understand why. And then when COVID hit, obviously I wasn't going to the hair salon. I wasn't getting my hair colored, and I was like, you know what? This is a great time to reset my hair, try to figure out why I'm stuck at this length, why I'm having breakage. And that's when I started experimenting with natural oils and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/hair/g45867155/best-hair-masks/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hair masks" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">hair masks</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The truth is I realized that my hair just needed a break. I didn't color it for about a year. I did so much research—YouTube tutorials, TikToks, just kind of hearing how people's hair journeys and I even made my own concoctions. I mean, I was so bored [during that time]. But it worked. And thinking back, I was kind of able to regain the integrity of my hair by giving it a rest.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Your sleek bun is your famed “lazy girl” hairstyle. What are some other beauty go-tos you like to do when you only have a few minutes?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I do my sleek bun in many different ways. I would say when I'm really running out of the door, instead of maybe doing a high bun, which will take more time, I'll just part my hair down the middle and brush it straight down with some oil and some cream and do a low bun, which doesn't involve parting it into threes. So I would say that's kind of my go-to quickie. But I've also been doing my sleek bun for so many years that it really doesn't take me a lot of time. I definitely have textured curly hair, so I have to put a bit of thought into it. I can't just let my hair air dry and go out.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Is there any beauty advice you got from your mom that you hope to pass down to your own daughter?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My mom is a Greek woman. She is very much about health, whether that's hair health, skin health—but most of all internal health. She's always instilled in me eating healthy, drinking plenty of water, exercising, and that beauty doesn't really shine on the outside unless it's shining on the inside. So she always taught me to have a routine. I followed the same routine for so many years and was mindful of what I put in my body and how I take care of myself. So that's definitely something that I will pass on to my daughter.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/lettermark.934d28d.svg?primary=%2523000" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=100 width=100 alt=Lettermark style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p><br>Lindy Segal is a beauty writer and editor.
