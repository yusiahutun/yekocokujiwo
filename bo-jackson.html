The athlete keeps himself occupied, be it with his efforts in charities, or delivering speeches at universities to inspire the youths. Furthermore, he even joined the Chicago White Sox in January 2014 as an Ambassador.</p><h2>Bo Jackson's Staggering Net Worth</h2><p>Bo Jackson was a revelation when the Los Angeles Raiders signed him as the round 1 pick 1 in the 1986 NFL draft.
