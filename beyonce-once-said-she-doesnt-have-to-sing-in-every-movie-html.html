It makes sense. If you hire Beyoncé, you want the total package. So even Obsessed and <a href=#>The Pink Panther</a> have a Beyoncé song, then there are the musicals <a href=#>Dreamgirls</a> and <a href=#>The Lion King</a>. Even Austin Powers in Goldmember has two, but the singer said at the time she didn’t have to sing in every movie.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Beyonce-at-the-Dreamgirls-premiere.jpg><h2 id=h-in-austin-powers-beyonc-had-to-sing>In ‘Austin Powers,’ Beyoncé had to sing</h2><p id=par-2_27>Austin Powers in Goldmember was Beyoncé’s first movie after her success in Destiny’s Child. As ’70s spy Foxxy Cleopatra, she sings “Hey Goldmember” and “Work It Out.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_64>“I think they had me in mind, was told they had me in mind for Foxxy,” she said at the Austin Powers press junket. “When they first approached me, it was in the script. I think that’s why they wanted a singer. Maybe they didn’t, I don’t know, but I’m happy. I was really more comfortable, because my first scene was doing the singing.”</p><h2 id=h-beyonc-was-afraid-of-being-typecast-until-she-remembered-her-heroes>Beyoncé was afraid of being typecast until she remembered her heroes</h2><p id=par-4_35>After Austin Powers, she starred in the gospel comedy The Fighting Temptations. She was concerned that all Beyoncé movies would have to be musicals, until she remembered some other great actor/singers who made it work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Beyonce-and-Steve-Martin.jpg><p id=par-5_53>“At first I didn’t want to do Fighting Temptations because I was a singer,” she said. “And I said, ‘People are gonna think every movie I have to be a singer.’ But then I said, ‘Well, Barbra Streisand and Diana Ross always sang, and that’s not bad. It was hot. So why not?’”</p><h2 id=h-she-would-do-movies-where-she-doesn-t-sing>She would do movies where she doesn’t sing</h2><p id=par-6_40>Beyoncé would keep finding roles that asked her to sing, like Dreamgirls or playing Etta James in Cadillac Records and covering some of her classics. Obsessed was purely a dramatic part, but she still sang a song for the film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Beyonce-and-Etta-James.jpg><p id=par-7_38>“If I see a role that doesn’t have singing in it, I’m not going to say I don’t want to do it,” she said. “But if it’s a good role and it has it in it, why not?”</p><h2 id=h-beyonc-had-to-learn-to-sing-in-movies>Beyoncé had to learn to sing in movies</h2><p id=par-8_36>Austin Powers taught Beyoncé that movies were a different process than recording and music videos. When she sang “Hey Goldmember,” she had to be Foxxy Cleopatra in the world of Austin Powers, not her music videos.</p><p id=par-9_45>“It was very similar, except I couldn’t look into the camera,” she said. “That was the hardest thing. And that was the first day of my shooting, so I really wasn’t used to that. So I was performing and like, ‘Don’t look in the Camera!’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvpsXOp5qeZZ%2BjsKZ50pqgnWWjnbJusM6eqqesXZ2ut7GMraZmq5mjtG61zWacr52irnquu9WinGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./galesburg-police-need-help-locating-wanted-individuals.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Galesburg Police need help locating wanted individuals</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-goldfish-masked-singer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who's Goldfish on The Masked Singer 2024?
