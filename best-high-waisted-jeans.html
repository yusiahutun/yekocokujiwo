If you don’t already have a pair of Levi’s, take this as your sign to do so. The trusted retailer is known for its quality denim, which typically feels thick, rigid, and comfortable. This pair has two percent elastane woven into the fabric, giving it some stretch and mobility. It’s fitted and form-hugging around the bum and waist but finishes in a straight cut. You can choose between a short and regular inseam length, measuring 30 and 32 inches respectively. Fair warning, however, that even though it’s labeled as “short,” 30 inches is not exactly “petite.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–33 | <strong>Rise: </strong>10.25 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, viscose, polyester, elastomultiester, elastane | <strong>Washes:</strong> 28</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-rag--bone-wren-dominique-full-length-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rag & Bone Wren Dominique Full Length Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rag &amp;amp; Bone Wren Dominique Full Length Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/jc3Q0q3B2WEeRPCx3rTJrg4RC10=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rag--Bone-Wren-Dominique-Full-Length-Straight-Jeans-22d858903e874f3b8508f3782f557e5b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rag & Bone</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>According to its <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">honor code</a>, the brand guarantees high quality and will fix or replace anything that doesn't fit the bill.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s only offered in one color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rag & Bone embraces the classic Americana style, with an edginess reflecting its birth city of New York and fine tailoring stemming from the Brits. These everyday jeans are a manifestation of the brand's ethos, showcasing clean lines through the stitchings, high-quality soft cotton in the body, and a universally loved medium-wash color.

Offered in sizes 00–40 (or 4XS–4XL), these jeans look good no matter who wears them. A mild flare at the hem and a form-hugging top creates a curvy illusion while elongating the legs. With four percent elastane in the denim, they’re extra stretchy and thus easy to slip into. Style-wise, we love the Dark Indigo color for a more polished look, and for something more casual, the Distressed Vintage Blue is the way to go.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–40 | <strong>Rise: </strong>9.5–18 inches | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, elastane | <strong>Washes:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-curvy-everlane-the-curvy-90s-cheeky-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Curvy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Curvy ’90s Cheeky Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Curvy &amp;rsquo;90s Cheeky Jean" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SLIQhP_mQCP1hN2xoJVLeue0zvY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-curvy-90s-cheeky-jean-26bade3125b0462f93e51ce2c9dbe61d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With an adjusted hip-to-waist ratio, these jeans hug all your curves.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The pants run small, so size up if you are between sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">High-waisted jeans flatter hourglass figures unlike any other style because they sit at the smallest part of the waist, hugging all of your curves properly. These jeans from Everlane further enhance the effect with an adjusted hip-to-waist ratio to create a form-hugging fit through the hip and thigh. Sustainably made from Japanese cotton, this pair gives you that retro rigid feel. The ankle length fits shorter folks who constantly have to hem their pants well, but you can also shop the straight leg in a regular inseam (two inches longer than the petite). The style does run a little small, though, so you should take this into account as you shop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–33 | <strong>Rise: </strong>11.5 inches<strong> </strong>| <strong>Material: </strong>Organic cotton | <strong>Washes:</strong>&nbsp;4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-good-american-soft-tech-good-classic-slim-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Soft Tech Good Classic Slim Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Soft Tech Good Classic Slim Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vicqSk7vV2h7rvrznW3DhEiZts4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Good-American-Soft-Tech-Good-Classic-Slim-Straight-Jeans-91443e7b36c34457a888b79ff052c076.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They are so soft that they rival our favorite sweatpants.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>From our experience, Good American denim sizes run a little large, so size down if you’re feeling unsure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Do yourself a favor, and buy any jeans from Good American’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Soft Tech collection</a>.

Some of our favorite supermodels (aka long-legged-ladies) have been seen sporting Frame denim, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Giselle Bündchen</a> and Kendall Jenner. I, too, have a pair of the jeans, so I can say they look perfect when paired with some heeled booties on my 5-foot, 8-inch tall body. Note that the inseam length is 34.5 inches which is so long that most brands don’t even offer it. Having tried a bunch of jeans throughout my lifetime, I didn’t think something as standard as jeans could impress me much further, but these surely did. The quality is undeniable, balancing between thick and stretchy and substantial. I’m extremely happy to finally find jeans that don’t look cropped on my legs.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 23–34 | <strong>Rise: </strong>10 inches | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, lyocell, polyester, elastane | <strong>Washes:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-skinny-good-american-good-legs-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Skinny</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Good Legs Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MRcFWIFPiDfq4R_BLRHG2ILI1LU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Good-American-Good-Legs-Skinny-Jeans-bdd3a91d2cae4fc19572c3313264dc2a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The jeans are very stretchy and easy to slip into.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The cut is only offered in one color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Good American truly does promise good legs here. These skinny jeans fit like a glove when I tried them on, hugging every curve and elongating my legs. The material was substantial and didn’t look or feel thin, which I appreciated. They’re also very stretchy which made it much easier to slip into, compared to my notoriously uncomfortable skinny jeans from high school. Please be aware that there is a whopping 6-inch difference between the regular and the long inseam lengths (29 and 35 inches respectively). On me, the 29-inch version did feel slightly cropped at the ankle, but it’s nothing I couldn’t hide with some booties.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–32 | <strong>Rise: </strong>10 inches | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Washes:</strong> 1<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-straight-reformation-liza-ultra-high-rise-straight-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Straight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Liza Ultra High Rise Straight Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Liza Ultra High Rise Straight Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lc5kIYB2oUc3UxZi5AMlvAISbok=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Liza-Ultra-High-Rise-Straight-Jeans-51f0ec15175e43eeb4b8d718c0535fc7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The material is nice and thick.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The rigid denim takes some time to soften.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Reformation</a>, the label best known for its flirty dresses, also happens to make high-quality denim.

When you think of the perfect “straight cut,” these are a picture of it — they’re not too baggy or too skin-tight around the butt. They’re modest and elegant, making them appropriate for almost all occasions (even casual Fridays at the office, if that’s still a thing). The material is also substantially thick and hasn’t shown a single wear or tear over the years.

Light distressing can be found around the knees, so be careful not to get that caught in anything.

These wide-leg pants will quickly become your new favorite go-to’s, thanks to the comforting stretch (it contains two percent elastane) and loose silhouette. When worn with heels, they’ll have an elongating effect on your legs. With sneakers, they ooze '90s vibes. You can’t go wrong with either look, truly.

They have both a high waist and an extra-long leg, making them bunch up at the feet for a modern take on the '90s grunge look. More notably you’ll find the big cargo pockets down the front of the pants, sitting against a dark navy blue canvas.

Perhaps it's the dark wash or the high-quality material, but these pants could easily be dressed up for a night out. If you’d rather spend the day indoors, however, the comfort stretch and soft fabric make it inviting to do so. While most denim pieces are dominantly constructed with cotton, these are composed of 69 percent Tencel lyocell, which is an eco-friendly fiber produced from wood that’s smooth, soft, and kind to sensitive skin. You can look polished and feel relaxed while wearing these, which is a true win in our books. And if you’re worried they might be too long on you, don’t be, as it’s offered in a standard, petite, and tall length. We only wish it came with more color options to choose from as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>23–37<strong> </strong>| <strong>Rise: </strong>11.87 inches | <strong>Material: </strong>Tencel lyocell, recycled cotton, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Washes:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-wit--wisdom-high-waist-skinny-jeans></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wit & Wisdom High Waist Skinny Jeans</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wit &amp;amp; Wisdom High Waist Skinny Jeans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/EP8TJKkTK1-FGJOFZXJU2Jg_eGc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ab-solution-high-waist-ankle-skinny-jeans-abb8f7ab5d1343edb583564925aa61de.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re wonderfully stretchy and comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They may have a bit of a jegging feel to them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Many brands nowadays offer jeans in various lengths to accommodate petite and tall folks. And while you’ll find plenty of petite options scattered throughout this story, we found these classic skinny jeans to be the best everyday option, inclusive of a wide size range. The petite pants come with an inseam of 26 inches and a 10.25-inch-high waist for women 5 feet, 3 inches tall and under. With a mix of cotton, polyester, and elastane, these jeans are wonderfully stretchy and comfortable — a required trait considering how form-fitting they are. The legging-esque nature of these pants might feel almost too tight on some, which is something worth noting if you are looking for something with a looser cut.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>24–34 | <strong>Rise: </strong>10.25 inches | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, elastane | <strong>Washes:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tummy-control-spanx-wide-leg-jeans-raw-indigo-shade></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tummy-Control</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx Wide Leg Jeans, Raw Indigo Shade</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Spanx Wide Leg Jeans, Raw Indigo Shade" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/SNGdbvLyF5JLfauhy4_fRBSC1FE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wide-leg-jeans-raw-indigo-shade--7e0f81cc6a2d4946b0d4614806cec3ea.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They hide core-shaping technology at the waist.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The button is faux and there are no zippers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although not a necessity, a cinch of the waist can make us feel great, and who better to turn to for shaping expertise than Spanx? These pants conceal core-shaping technology around the waist, so a bystander would be none the wiser, however, and will only see the sleek long wide legs. Emphasis on the word long, here, as they’re intentionally lengthy and made to be worn with heels. For reference, the petite has a 30-inch inseam. Keep in mind that these are pull-on pants — there are no zippers and the button you see is faux.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–3XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Rise: </strong>11 inches | <strong>Material: </strong>Cotton, polyester, elastane<strong> </strong>| <strong>Washes:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><strong>Rise: </strong>The rise of your jeans is the distance from the waistband to the crotch seam. High-waisted jeans start at a 10-inch rise but can go up to 12 inches. Celebrity stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Karla Welch</a> says 10.5 inches is the sweet spot, while some may prefer a higher rise, especially if you are tall or have a long torso.</li><li><strong>Inseam: </strong>The inseam is the measurement of the base of the zipper to the bottom of the leg opening. If you struggle with jeans either being too long or too short, start paying attention to the inseam and seek out styles that come in tall or petite sizing as these have longer and shorter inseams, respectively. "For petite women, inseams will range between 21 inches and 30 inches depending on the style of jeans. For example, when wearing skinny jeans look for an inseam between 25 inches and 27 inches," says stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Jessica Smith</a>. "If you're bringing back a bootcut style with a stacked heel you will want to look for jeans with a 28- to 30-inch inseam. If you're ready to rock a cropped straight-leg jean, pair them with studded mules, and seek denim that is 23 inches to 25 inches long." Nichole recommends taking the measurements of a pair of your favorite jeans and comparing them against the sizing guides. If you’re still unsure what size to buy, use our handy<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3> guide on finding the best jeans for your body type</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fabric Content: </strong>As you will see from this list, some jeans are made from 100 percent cotton, while others have a little elastane or spandex mixed in. While pure cotton blends don't have "built-in" stretch, they will form with time, molding to your body. If you prefer the vintage feel and look of rigid denim, go for 100 percent cotton. If you prefer a little bit of stretch in your jeans, especially in form-fitting styles like skinny jeans, consider a blend of materials. The touch of synthetic materials also helps the jeans recover to their original shape after a wash. In the end, however, it’s a matter of preference. Nichole notes that structured denim made of 100 percent cotton doesn’t lose shape throughout the day (or years) and therefore finds them to be a better investment.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the pros and cons of high-waisted jeans?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Choosing between rises is mainly about comfort and aesthetics, but the high rise has some advantages. They let you wear shorter tops and bustiers that show off your waist, without necessarily showing too much skin. In highlighting the smallest part of your waist, the cut creates the illusion of long legs, which makes them a great option for those with a long torso.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">On the other hand, longer tops and bulky sweaters may look awkward with a high rise, especially if there is too much fabric to tuck into the pants seamlessly. For those who are used to wearing mid and/or low-rise jeans, the higher rise may feel uncomfortable and restrictive with the extra fabric. Ideally, you will own a few jeans in different rises, so you can find the best fit for your outfit and mood for any given day.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do I style high-waisted jeans?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">High-rise jeans are so popular because they're widely flattering and can be dressed up or down with ease, too. During the day, you can pair them with just about anything, whether that's a crop top or a tucked-in tee or sweater. For an evening look, Welch recommends pairing a bodysuit or corset with high-waisted jeans. Throw in some heels and a blazer, and you're ready to hit the town.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can I wear high-waisted jeans if I'm petite?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes, so don't let the extra fabric intimidate you. High-waisted jeans do a great job of elongating your legs and adding definition and balance to your outfit, says Smith. Just make sure to shop for the right inseam length when you do.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a> is a commerce writer at InStyle.
