That's annoying, especially if you're not actually doing anything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Generally, you can avoid&nbsp;maxing out your CPU by staying away from demanding apps. Sometimes, however, a bug can cause CPU usage&nbsp;to spin out of control, such as the infamous WmiPrvSE.exe. In most cases, you can easily fix the underlying issue and lower high CPU usage, and we'll show you how.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-cpu>What Is the CPU?</h2><p>The CPU (central processing unit), also known as the processor, is your computer's brain. It manages all active processes. Like your own noggin, it can become overwhelmed if bombarded with too many processes or if a single task consumes undue attention. Just as you may find&nbsp;it difficult to focus when feeling overwhelmed, your <a href=#>processor can slow to a crawl</a> if too much is asked of it at once.</p><p>Now let's see what's throwing your CPU off.</p><h2 id=is-the-wmi-provider-host-wmiprvse-exe-causing-high-cpu-usage>Is the WMI Provider Host (WmiPrvSE.EXE) Causing High CPU Usage?</h2><p>The WMI Provider Host process, also known as Windows Management Instrumentation or WmiPrvSE.exe, is part of Windows and assists organizations in monitoring and troubleshooting a large number of systems on a network. It's not uncommon for the process to go out of control, however.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can tell if this is your problem by opening the <strong>Task Manager</strong>&nbsp;(press <strong>Control + Shift + ESC</strong>) and looking for the WmiPrvSE.exe process. If its CPU usage is higher than a few percent, and you're not running any program that would impact it, it's not functioning properly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Windows-Management-Instrumentation-670x348.png><h3 id=restart-the-wmi-provider-host-to-fix-high-cpu-usage>Restart the WMI Provider Host to Fix High CPU Usage</h3><p>Microsoft recently pulled its official fix. The only option you're left with now is manually restarting the service.</p><li>Press <strong>Windows key + S,&nbsp;</strong>input <strong>Services,</strong>&nbsp;and press Enter.</li><li>In the window that opens, look for <strong>Windows Management Instrumentation</strong>.</li><li>Right-click it, then select <strong>Restart</strong>. You can also stop the service entirely, if you desire, or simply restart your computer.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Restart-Windows-Service-670x445.png><h3 id=identify-persistent-wmi-provider-host-issues-using-the-event-viewer>Identify Persistent WMI Provider Host Issues Using the Event Viewer</h3><p>If the issue with WmiPrvSE.exe keeps returning, use the Windows Event Viewer to identify its cause. It could be another system process that keeps the WMI provider host busy, thereby causing high CPU usage.</p><ul><li>In Windows 10 and 8, right-click the <strong>Start button</strong> and select <strong>Event Viewer</strong>.</li><li>In Windows 7, use the Start menu to find and launch <strong>Eventvwr.msc</strong>.</li></ul><p>Inside the Event Viewer app, go to <strong>Applications and Service Logs > Microsoft > Windows > WMI-Activity > Operational</strong>.</p><p>Now scroll through the list of operational events and find recent&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong> entries.</p><p>For each Error, identify the <strong>ClientProcessId</strong>.&nbsp;Note that every time you restart a process, its ID will change, hence there's no point in checking older errors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Windows-Event-Viewer-WMI-Activity.png><p>If you suspect that one of these processes is causing the high CPU usage, you can use its ID to find it in the Task Manager and identify the faulty process.</p><p>Open the <strong>Task Manager</strong> (press&nbsp;<strong>Control + Shift + ESC</strong>), switch to the <strong>Services</strong> tab, and sort all running services by <strong>PID</strong>, i.e., their process ID. If the guilty process is still running, you'll be able to identify it and investigate further.</p><p>Right-click the process and select <strong>Open File Location</strong> to review the software it belongs to. Updating or uninstalling the respective program may fix the WMI Provider Host's high CPU usage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, there's a possibility that the service could be a worm or virus. You should see only one version of the process at any given time, and the process should stop if you halt it through the Services window. If you see two versions of it, or the process will not stop, <a title="0 Steps To Take When You Discover Malware On Your Computer" href=#>run a virus scan</a> immediately.</p><h2 id=does-the-system-idle-process-exhibit-high-cpu-usage>Does the System Idle Process Exhibit High CPU Usage?</h2><p>Windows users occasionally run across a process called the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">System Idle Process</a> causing high CPU usage. This obscure process seems to hog all the CPU power it possibly can â€“ terrible, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/system-idle-process-consuming-CPU-resources.jpg><p>Actually, the System Idle Process is simply a thread that consumes CPU cycles, which are not otherwise being used. Instead, the process is used because of some very arcane peculiarities in coding, making it sometimes preferable and even more efficient for a processor to run something instead of nothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is not just a Windows thing, but Windows displays the process in the Task Manager, so users see it and assume something is wrong.</p><p>This is not to say you can't experience performance issues when the System Idle Process shows a high CPU usage load, but the issue lies elsewhere.</p><p>In fact, you should expect to see the System Idle Process report that it consumes 95% (or more) of your CPU when Windows is idling. If it's not, something else is consuming processor cycles without your knowledge.</p><h2 id=is-the-svchost-exe-netscvs-to-blame-for-high-cpu-usage>Is the Svchost.exe (netscvs) to Blame for High CPU Usage?</h2><p>You might have noticed that the&nbsp;svchost.exe (netscvs) process is causing <a href=#>high memory or CPU usage</a>&nbsp;if you checked the Task Manager. While this process is sometimes associated with malware, it's primarily&nbsp;a legitimate and system-critical Windows process. If you're unsure, use the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">svchost.exe Lookup Tool</a> to see which service the process refers to.</p><h3 id=disable-network-discovery>Disable Network Discovery</h3><p>If it's not malware, svchost.exe might be busy scanning for plug-and-play devices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To exclude this cause:</p><li>In the Start menu search bar, input <strong>Control Panel&nbsp;</strong>and select the Best match.</li><li>Head to <strong>Network and Internet >&nbsp;Network and Sharing Center</strong>, and click <strong>Change advanced sharing settings</strong>.</li><li>Here, select <strong>Turn off network discovery</strong>.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Control-Panel-Network-Discovery-Settings.jpg><h3 id=check-windows-update>Check Windows Update</h3><p>Svchost.exe (netsvcs) also shows high CPU usage when Windows is downloading updates. You'll commonly see it using 25% or more CPU capacity after you just installed Windows. In that case, just let Windows Update finish its thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Windows 10, you can't easily delay or pause Windows Update. While you can schedule when to install new updates, Windows downloads&nbsp;updates as needed. This may randomly cause svchost.exe to increase its CPU usage. What you can change, however, is whether your computer shares downloaded updates with peers. Turn this off to conserve bandwidth and processing power.</p><p>Head to <strong>Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update</strong>, click <strong>Advanced options</strong>, then click <strong>Delivery Optimization</strong>. Here you can <strong>Allow downloads from other PCs</strong>, but you'll want this set to <strong>Off</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Windows-10-Delivery-Optimization.jpg><p>From <strong>Delivery Optimization</strong>, click <strong>Advanced options</strong> once more.&nbsp;In this next screen,&nbsp;you can limit the bandwidth of downloads or uploads of Windows and app updates. You should set the <strong>download limit</strong>&nbsp;to a minimum of 5% and also set the <strong>monthly upload limit</strong> very low, in case you did permit downloads from other PCs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Windows-10-Download-Settings-Bandwith-Limit.jpg><p>The only other workaround to tame high CPU usage related to downloading updates is to <a href=#>temporarily disable Windows Update</a>.&nbsp;This will prevent Windows&nbsp;from downloading updates. However, we don't recommend this solution!</p><h2 id=are-too-many-background-processes-hogging-your-cpu>Are Too Many Background Processes Hogging Your CPU?</h2><p>A background process is a program that's running on your PC, even though it's not open in a window. A typical computer will have many background processes running simultaneously, as Windows itself requires some to run. But as you install programs over the years, you may collect more and more and eventually overwhelm your PC.</p><p>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, then select&nbsp;<strong>Task Manager</strong> from the list.&nbsp;The <strong>Processes</strong> tab will appear by default, displaying not only overall CPU usage but also the usage of each app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You should do this while no other programs are open to prevent confusion. Note the processes that appear to use at least 10% of your processor's capability regularly.</p><p><strong>In Windows 10</strong>, head over to the <strong>Startup</strong> tab within the Task Manager.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Windows-10-Startup-Items-670x463.png><p><strong>In Windows 7</strong>, exit Task Manager and open msconfig.exe via Windows Search or the Run dialog (<strong>Windows key + R</strong>). In the System Configuration window,&nbsp;head to the <strong>Startup</strong> tab.</p><p>Now <a href=#>find startup items</a> correlated with the items that you noted. Uncheck them, click okay, and then restart your PC. This will stop those programs from launching at boot.</p><h2 id=it-could-be-an-annoying-antivirus>It Could Be an Annoying Antivirus</h2><p>Do you notice that your computer becomes slow at seemingly random times, and those times often correlate with high disk activity? Your problem could be your antivirus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When actively searching your disk for a threat, an antivirus program can create a surprising amount of processor load. This usually isn't enough to&nbsp;cause lag on a modern desktop or high-end laptop, but older or&nbsp;underpowered systems may noticeably slow under the strain.</p><p>Fixing this is easy. Virtually all <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer sponsored" class="norewrite noskim">anti-virus apps</a> come with a scheduling function that lets you adjust when it automatically scans. Change the schedule to a time when you're not using the laptop, and you'll no longer be bothered.</p><h2 id=high-cpu-usage-is-caused-by-malware>High CPU Usage Is Caused by Malware</h2><p>Malware can cause high CPU usage, too. A system that's infected may run processes in the background, and it may attempt to spread itself by sending malware to others via your email, your network, or other sources. All of this requires processing power, which can translate to poor performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Confirming an infection manually is not easy, and for the layman is more guesswork than anything else. If you don't have an anti-virus, <a href=#>download a free malware application</a>&nbsp;and run it. In fact, you may want to try several anti-malware tools because malware that's already installed has the advantage; it may be able to hide from any single anti-virus app.</p><p>Once you've found the problem, you can remove it with the anti-virus app you used to scan. If that fails, read <a title="The Complete Malware Removal Guide" href=#>our malware removal guide</a>; the tips there can help you exorcise whatever has possessed your PC.</p><h2 id=high-cpu-usage-could-be-anything>High CPU Usage&nbsp;Could Be Anything</h2><p>High CPU usage can be hard to track down. While the problems listed here are among the most common causes, you may find that CPU usage is still an issue even after trying everything suggested above. If this problem still plagues you, find a Windows support forum where you can ask users&nbsp;for advice about dealing with your particular situation.</p><p>But first, here's one last culprit you could check: high CPU usage caused by system interrupts!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fm7a5eceinqFlk6XCbsHSmp6eZaeeu6W71qxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mtv-vmas-ashantis-clear-message-shes-back-with-old-flame-after-10-years-apart.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>MTV VMAs: Ashanti's clear message she's back with old flame after 10 years apart</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-i-stopped-shaving-my-bikini-line-5386954.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Why I Stopped Shaving My Bikini Line</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
