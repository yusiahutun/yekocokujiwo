But here are some facts about the fall that people still talk about even today.</p><h3 id=492165-1-where-did-joan-murray-work class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>1. Where did Joan Murray work?</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Joan Murray </a>worked at the Bank of America Corporation during the week and went skydiving on weekends. She was a moderately experienced skydiver who had completed 35 dives, some of which were solo. On 25 January 1999, she travelled to Chester County, South Carolina, United States, to prepare for her 36th dive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/42c3544b008d4e72.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Marie Carlson murder case update: Where is James Flanders today?</span></p></a><h3 id=492165-2-how-far-did-joan-murray-fall class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. How far did Joan Murray fall?</h3><p class=align-left>Everything seemed normal on that day because she prepared her gear, boarded the plane, and nothing was out of the ordinary when she flew 14,500 feet above the ground. But Joan had new skydiving gear that she wanted to try out. So, when it was time to jump out of the plane, everything was in order, and she was now ready.</p><p class=align-left>After a free-fall of unspecified duration, Joan Murray skydiver, pulled the cord to release the main chute. But unlike other days, nothing happened. So, she continued falling and started spinning out of control. Fortunately, she cut her main parachute, remained calm, and pulled the cord on her reserve parachute.</p><p class=align-left>Luckily, the reserve chute opened as she had expected. Unfortunately, however, the reserve chute opened when Joan was still spinning, unable to reorient herself. Although the reserve chute inflated, it became tangled and continued to spin. At the same time, Joan Murray continued falling towards the ground fast and had already fallen more than two miles and 700 feet from impact.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/663346dad692c4ab.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to the Digital Princess? Arrest and whereabouts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since Joan Murray was now 700 feet from impact, her reserve chute failed because of the tangling. As a result, she free-fell from a height of 700 feet downwards at a speed of 80 miles per hour or 128 kilometres per hour. Joan Murray survived the impact when her body hit the ground and remained conscious until the paramedics rescued her.</p><h3 id=492165-3-how-did-joan-murray-survive class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. How did Joan Murray survive?</h3><p class=align-left>Joan Murray's skydiving accident was more of a miracle. She landed on a mound of angry fire ants when she hit the ground. She was conscious after the point of impact, breathless, and unable to move.</p><p class=align-left>But Joan Murray felt a sudden burning sensation in her back followed by several stings. Each sting was more painful than the previous ones, thanks to the angry ants that stung her for landing on their territory.</p><p class=align-left>The ant stings were venomous. Thus, they shocked her heart and kept it beating. Also, the stings caused her body to produce more adrenaline which kept her alive until the paramedics arrived, gave her some quick aid and transported her <a href=#>to the hospital</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4346c02f3e39f756.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Jamie Auld?

What injuries did Joan Murray sustain?</h3><p class=align-left>When she arrived at the Carolina Medical Center, doctors determined that Joan Murray skydiver injuries included shattered bones on the right side of her body, and she lost a few teeth. Thus, they put her in a coma and performed 20 reconstructive surgeries and 17 blood transfusions.</p><p class=align-left>The surgeries included inserting a metal rod into her right leg and 5-inch spikes into her pelvis. Also, Joan Murray suffered a comminuted femur fracture. Fortunately, Joan had no significant hollow viscus injuries to the organs within her abdominal cavity or closed head injuries.</p><p class=align-left>Joan Murray was in a coma for two weeks as <a href=#>doctors attended to her</a>. After coming out of the coma, she began physical therapy and ran short distances. However, she did it moderately to avoid damaging her already fractured body.</p><h3 id=492165-5-did-joan-murray-return-to-skydiving class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. Did Joan Murray return to skydiving</h3><p class=align-left>Two years after surviving the accident, Joan Murray returned to the skies.

However, it is unknown whether she is still alive since she stopped appearing in public three years after the accident.</p><p class=align-left>Joan Murray skydiver, jumped from the plane at the height of 14,500 feet. Unfortunately, her chute did not open as usual, forcing her to free-fall 700 feet above ground at 80 miles per hour. Luckily, Joan Murray fell on a mound of angry fire ants that stung her over 200 times. The venom stings shocked her heart, forcing it to keep beating and boosting her adrenaline. It also kept her conscious until help came. Two years later, she returned to the skies and jumped on another plane, grateful to be alive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d8baa2813706146f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Rachel Hawes and is she still alive today?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke shared an article about<a href=#> Tatyana Ali</a>.
