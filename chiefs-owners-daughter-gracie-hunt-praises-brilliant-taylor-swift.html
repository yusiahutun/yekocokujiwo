It would be two months before Swift was spotted cheering him on at Arrowhead Stadium, but she recently revealed that the twosome were already “a couple” before she attended her first game in September.</p><p>“I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date,” she teased in a TIME Magazine cover story earlier this month.</p><p>Swift has since made connections with Kelce’s immediate family and his Chiefs family, from quarterback <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong>‘ wife, <strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong>, to Gracie and her sister, <strong>Ava Hunt</strong>.</p><p>“Enchanted to meet you @taylorswift ♥️,” Ava captioned an Instagram upload on December 10, posing with Swift in a VIP suite at the stadium. The pic showed Ava holding a gift wrapped in purple and pink paper, which she said was a “birthday surprise” for Swift.</p><p>Gracie later revealed <a href=#>what was inside the box</a> while marking Swift’s birthday on December 13. “Happy birthday to this queen!💖 Bright, beautiful, beyond talented and engaging…easiest decision Time Magazine ever made for Person of the Year. Hope it’s your best & most blessed year yet!🫶🏼,” she captioned photos of herself meeting Swift over the years, including one snapped in the Chiefs suite.</p><p>The Hunt family gave Swift a microphone purse from Judith Leiber Couture. “Thank you @joshie_82 and @neimanmarcusnorthpark for procuring the perfect @judithleiberny gift!🎤✨,” Gracie gushed in her caption.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Swift’s presence at Chiefs games has been a hot topic throughout the season, with broadcasters even commenting on her absence at the games she’s missed. She told TIME earlier this month that she has no idea how many times she’s shown on screen — and <a href=#>sent a message to sports fans</a> who aren’t happy to see her in the crowd.</p><p>“I’m just there to support Travis. I have no awareness of if I’m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads and Chads,” she said, adding, “Football is awesome, it turns out. I’ve been missing out my whole life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJmas7R5zrClnqqjYrGiwcahq56qXZy%2Foq%2FInmShrZ6perG%2BwKKqnqtdl7%2BquMuimKesXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-pratt-guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-sign-language-apology-instagram.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Pratt Uses Sign Language to Apologize to Hearing Impaired for 'Incredibly Insensitive' Instagr</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./men-up-bbc-series-cast-iwan-rheon-paul-rhys-mark-lewis-jones-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>BBC's Men Up: meet the cast including Outlander and Game of Thrones stars</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
