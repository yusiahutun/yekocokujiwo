class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The case had sparked outrage across the archipelago, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">which came under direct rule from London in 2009</a> after it found widespread corruption in the Caribbean British territory.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Chief Justice Mabel Agyemang on Monday found <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">former deputy premier Floyd Hall</a> guilty of bribery.

His lawyer did not respond to a message for comment.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In addition, Agyemang found former government minister Jeffrey Hall and attorney Melbourne Wilson not guilty of conspiracy to defraud. Hall’s attorney, Ian Wilkinson, told the Associated Press that his client is grateful for a “just and true verdict”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“He had maintained his innocence from the beginning and is happy to have been vindicated,” Wilkinson said, adding that Hall would speak further at a later date.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Wilson’s attorney did not respond to a message for comment.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The suspects had been arrested after the British government suspended the Turks and Caicos government in August 2009 and imposed direct rule after a commission of inquiry had found systemic corruption in the Caribbean British territory.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Most of the corruption consisted of bribery by overseas developers and others to secure government land on “favourable terms, coupled with government approval for its commercial development”, according to the commission’s report.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>A 2009 interim report also found “clear signs of political amorality and immaturity and of general administrative incompetence”.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The charges against the accused were first filed in 2011, with the prosecution requesting that a trial without jury be held.
