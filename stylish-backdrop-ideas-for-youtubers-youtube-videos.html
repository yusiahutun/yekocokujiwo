One of these elements is often the backdrop, but it's an easy thing to fix.</p><p>We're going to discuss the importance of your backdrop style, and the ease and affordability of executing them. We will also suggest some stylish backdrop ideas for your next YouTube video.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=why-you-need-a-stylish-backdrop>Why You Need a Stylish Backdrop</h2><p>While your viewers primarily watch your videos for you and your content, the visual components of a video are more important than you'd think. People want to enjoy what they're looking at, or they're more likely to click away.</p><p>A stylish backdrop allows viewers to associate an aesthetic with your brand, which will ultimately make you more recognizable and up your views. It will also let them know that you put effort into the production, leading them to put more trust in you as a content creator—this is how you capture and maintain a loyal following online.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Starting a YouTube Channel? Basics You Need to Get Right</a></span></p><p>Think of the backdrop style as a tool that aids in the production value of your content. Not only does it set the stylistic mood for the video, but it can also complement the genre of your content, helping viewers paint a fully rounded picture of your channel.</p><h2 id=how-to-obtain-a-stylish-backdrop>How to Obtain a Stylish Backdrop</h2><p>Putting this much emphasis on the backdrop might make you anxious—we get it, YouTubers already have their hands full with tons of other factors that go into video creation. But backdrops are usually budget-friendly and easy to set up.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The majority of styles can be achieved through print or a green screen. So if you want to incorporate a brick wall in your backdrop, there's no need to move your entire recording setup in front of an actual brick wall; simply print it onto a paper or fabric sheet, or film with a green screen sheet and add the brick in editing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Is a Green Screen and How Does It Work?</a></span></p><p>There's a wide variety of sheet designs on the market, and some companies also let you customize your own. A background support structure is ideal, but you can get by without one and use high-strength tape or adhesive instead.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=10-backdrop-styles-for-your-youtube-videos>10 Backdrop Styles for Your YouTube Videos</h2><p>Here are some of the best styles for your YouTube backdrop:</p><h3 id=solid-color>1. Solid Color</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/man-vlogging-paper-screen-backdrop.jpeg><p>A solid color is ideal for the indecisive or impatient YouTuber. If you're not keen on putting that much effort into a backdrop, you can't go wrong with a solid color. All you need to do is pick a color that represents your brand the best, and don't forget to pay attention to its intensity and brightness.</p><h3 id=ombre-colors>2. Ombre Colors</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ombre-colors.jpeg><p>Ombre colors are another safe and simple choice for those who don't want to go all out. They add more appeal than solid colors because they involve two or more colors and there's a gradual blend from one to the next. You get to express the color pallet of your brand a little more with this option.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=brick-wall>3. Brick Wall</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/painted-brick-wall.jpeg><p>A brick wall print (or an actual brick wall if it's an option) makes for a very stylish backdrop. Bricks combine sophistication with a rustic aesthetic and can be incorporated in a high number of styles. There are many different brick colors, shapes, textures, and sizes, so you're bound to find a brick design that compliments your brand.</p><h3 id=wood-panels>4. Wood Panels</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/painted-wood-panels.jpeg><p>Wooden panels are another great stylistic choice. It's classy, but not too cold or minimalist. Wood can be painted any color, as the size and layout of the panels also vary greatly. The panels can even feature some imperfections in the wood, which will help make it look more realistic if it's printed.</p><h3 id=glitter>5. Glitter</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sequin-glitter-fabric.jpeg><p>Glitter backdrops are great for YouTubers who love sparkle. It can be printed, but that won't translate as well as the real deal. There are stores that sell glitter fabric (usually sequins sewn onto mesh) which can easily transform into a backdrop. You might need to place another sheet behind it since glitter fabrics tend to be see-through.</p><h3 id=patterns>6. Patterns</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/repetitive-triangular-pattern.jpeg><p>Repetitive patterns are very satisfying to look at and add an artistic touch. Since there are infinite variations in size, shape, color, and complexity, it's probably best to stick to a simple pattern, such as stripes. This way you won't get swallowed by your backdrop and your viewers won't get too distracted.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=bookshelf>7. Bookshelf</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bookself.jpeg><p>A bookshelf can be incorporated into various aesthetics, depending on its look. White shelves work well with a contemporary style, while darker woods can create a dark academia aesthetic. Of course, you don't need to actually buy a bookshelf, just print one! This way you can also customize the books and deco on the shelves.</p><h3 id=newspaper>8. Newspaper</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/newspaper-collage-on-wall.jpeg><p>If you've got a stack of newspapers and are willing to subject one of your walls to some glue, you don't need to print this one. A newspaper aesthetic gives off a vintage vibe, as long as the print isn't too colorful.</p><h3 id=graffiti>9. Graffiti</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/graffiti-print.jpeg><p>Unless you're a graffiti artist yourself, using graffiti in your backdrop is a great opportunity to promote an artist's work. You can have it painted onto a sheet manually or printed digitally. This is an attractive art form to incorporate into your videos, and there are so many types of graffiti styles to choose from.</p><h3 id=wall-decorations>10. Wall Decorations</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/coffee-themed-wall-deco.jpeg><p>Decorating a wall is the perfect method to include more than one element into your backdrop and create a theme. Think frames, mirrors, vinyl records, posters, and anything else that can go up on a wall. If you have a wall that you're willing to sacrifice to nails and adhesive, it's one of the most customizable types of backdrops.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=get-stylish-with-your-youtube-backdrops>Get Stylish With Your YouTube Backdrops</h2><p>A stylish backdrop is as important as any other component of video creation. It's affordable and easy to set up, so there's no excuse not to have one. Try one of the styles listed here for your next video, or combine some of them, and watch the overall production value of your content increase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiqrbGcnsCpecGamqScoqS9brXDnpisZZakv27Fzq6rrpqVp8Buxc6uq66alWLDqrDEqKpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./found-it-jessica-albas-sheer-petal-pink-lipstick.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Found It!
