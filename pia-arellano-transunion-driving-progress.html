Backed by major banks including BDO, BPI, Metrobank, Citibank, and HSBC, TransUnion Philippines emerged as the sole private comprehensive credit bureau, facilitating the exchange of credit data among its members. Initially centered on Financial Services, its scope has expanded to include Non-Bank Lenders, Digital Banks, Fintech Lenders, and Telco, showcasing its evolution from risk management to uncovering growth opportunities within portfolios.</p><p>TransUnion’s mission is rooted in empowering businesses and individuals with informed choices. By delving into data to reveal unique narratives, trends, and insights, it equips clients to navigate risks effectively and empowers consumers to manage credit and personal data. Guided by the ethos of “Information for Good,” TransUnion Philippines serves as a catalyst for financial inclusion, aligning with the nation’s progress.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Formative Educational Years</h3><p>Pia’s developmental years spanning through college were pivotal in shaping her leadership prowess and present identity. From early roles as a Class Officer to ascending to the Student Council Presidency at St. Pedro Poveda College at just 17, Pia imbibed the tenets of Servant Leadership and honed her ability to engage with a diverse array of individuals, enhancing her self-assurance and character.</p><p>Her university years at the prestigious University of the Philippines further underscored the value of humility. Interacting with peers from diverse backgrounds cultivated an open-minded outlook and an appreciation for differing viewpoints, enriching her personal growth and leadership journey.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Diverse Industry Experience</h3><p>Pia’s versatile career has spanned diverse sectors, including roles in banking (Citibank, CTBC), global payments (Visa), remittance services (Western Union), and telecommunications (Bayantel, Islacom). This well-rounded journey has thoughtfully prepared her for a <a href=#>leadership role</a> at TransUnion, a global data solutions enterprise.</p><p>At TransUnion, Pia acknowledges the significant role the company plays in nation-building. Empowering lenders to extend credit sets in motion a cycle of consumption, production, and job creation, ultimately contributing to economic growth and the well-being of Filipinos. Her varied industry background equips her to drive this vital task.</p><p>Notably, Pia’s achievements on the professional front include being the youngest Product Manager at Citibank, where she introduced the pioneering Ready Credit.

By fostering confidence in lenders and encouraging financial inclusivity, Pia champions the cause of financial empowerment.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Notable Achievement</h3><p>In 2020, Pia Arellano achieved a remarkable feat that fills her with immense pride.

This counsel emphasizes the vital connection between personal virtues and the nuanced execution of leadership roles.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Advancing Digital Services</h3><p>As digital transformation reshapes consumer expectations, lenders are compelled to rethink their service delivery methods. While seamless digital access has become the norm, the fusion of exceptional customer experiences with robust security measures is vital to protect against fraudulent activities.</p><p>TransUnion takes proactive steps with its comprehensive digital onboarding solution, combining identity verification, device authentication, and credit risk assessment. This empowers lenders to provide swift, secure decisions, ensuring a seamless experience for clients.</p><p>A noteworthy achievement by TransUnion is the Credit Perception Index Report, a benchmark for gauging Filipino sentiments toward credit.
