But he was caught when a victim’s friend spotted his suspicious behaviour and confronted him, causing him to flee in panic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tham pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism on Tuesday. The court heard that he was last sentenced to 10 months’ jail in November 2021 for similar offences.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On May 26 this year, Tham said he felt the urge to take voyeuristic videos again and made preparations. He chose a pair of shoes and cut a hole in the left one. He tested the placement of the hole by inserting his spare phone into the modified shoe, with the camera lens facing up.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tham then placed the footwear into a bag and set off for Jurong East MRT Station, where he slid the phone in the shoe before wearing it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He walked around filming women, picking his targets before positioning his foot under their skirts. He did so 11 times, taking videos of at least 12 women near the railway station at Jem shopping centre.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Singapore jails teacher for taking 170 upskirt videos of colleagues, students</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tham then went to a supermarket and targeted a 29-year-old woman. However, the victim’s friend noticed Tham placing his foot under the victim’s skirt and asked him what he was doing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tham panicked and fled, with the victim’s friend giving chase and shouting for Tham to stop. He was eventually detained by a passer-by outside the shopping centre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He admitted his acts and asked the victim’s friend, who was also a woman, to give him a chance. The woman called the police, who arrested Tham.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Essentially, he has been doing this exact same scheme since 2013Deputy Public Prosecutor Jotham Tay</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tham told investigators that he had taken the videos despite knowing it was an offence as he was feeling depressed. He said he wanted “to do acts that were thrilling enough to help him to reduce his stress and anxiety”, and he found voyeurism thrilling and felt excited when viewing the videos.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Deputy Public Prosecutor Jotham Tay asked for 15 to 18 months’ jail for Tham.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tham has two previous convictions – in November 2021 and March 2020. The March 2020 conviction included more than a hundred charges.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Essentially, he has been doing this exact same scheme since 2013,” Tay said. “What we have is an offender who is clearly recalcitrant. The gap in time between the reoffending behaviour is also short.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tay said Tham would have been released from his latest jail term of 10 months in mid-2022, which meant he reoffended after about a year.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Singapore jails repeat Panadol thief who stole dozens of boxes of painkillers</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tay said the crime was premeditated, as Tham had to cut a hole in his shoe and make sure the camera could record videos through the hole.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In mitigation, Tham, who was unrepresented, said he was very remorseful.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Like what was mentioned, actually I was going through a very rough time for the past at least five years because of this voyeuristic disorder that I’m facing,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Ever since that day, I’ve been struggling with regrets and I wish that I had done something else instead to cope with my emotions.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said he would accept the consequences, but planned to ask for a psychologist during his sentence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I’m out, I plan on seeking treatment as I really do not wish for this issue to linger any longer than it already has, as it has affected my life very negatively,” said Tham. “I wish to change and not offend any more.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The judge asked for further submissions on sentencing and adjourned the case to December.</p>This article was first published by <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">CNA</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miYrKGRZMCwwdOhnJqrpGKutLXAaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtrbGhoaHy0sdGimKVlo567qK3PqKmeZaWlwKy10a2cq2WRmbqqwNJmmq6spJ67qHnHqKOeZaOdvKZ505qinmWmpMamwdGiqq2hk2LDqrDEqKpmrpmYwaq50g%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aston-villa-leeds-united-premier-league-live.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aston Villa 2-1 Leeds United: Premier League as it happened | Premier League</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lord-of-the-rings-star-could-have-died-on-set-but-he-still-filmed-the-scary-scene.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lord of the Rings star could have died on set but he still filmed the scary scene</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
