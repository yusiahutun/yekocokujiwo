The TV star took to both <a href=#>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>Twitter</a> to confirm the news of her passing and post two sweet photos of Rosa on Thursday, Oct. 19. <strong>Watch the video below to read Mario’s sweet tribute to his grandmother.</strong></p><p>After Mario revealed his grandma’s death, his more than 970,000 Instagram followers began <a href=#>sending their condolences</a> to the actor and his family. “I am so sorry for your loss. She will forever live in your heart. May your Abuela [rest in peace],” one person wrote with another adding, “May God give you and your family strength during this difficult time???.” A third person kindly wrote, “I am so very sorry for you and your family’s loss. To lose our Abuelitas is to lose our greatest treasure, a piece of our history, as no one can tell the stories quite like they do. Praying for comfort, love, and strength for you and your family during this difficult time.”</p><p>In the past, Mario — who is a father to two kids Gia, 7, and Nico, 4, with <a href=#>wife Courtney Mazza Lopez</a> — has candidly spoken out about his family, faith, and why he is proud of his Latino background. “It’s so important. It’s a beautiful culture. I think you should be proud of your heritage and celebrate it and at the same [time], if you’re first generation like I am, you embrace American culture as well,” he <a href=#>said in a previous interview</a>. As for his parenting philosphy? Mario and Courtney, 35, are doing their best to raise their children to simply be good people.</p><p>“We try to go to church as a family every week… They’re definitely going to go to Catholic school. It’s really important to me that they get a faith-based education,” Mario told <a href=#>Parents</a> magazine in 2015. “First and foremost, [we’re teaching them] to treat others with respect. Be polite: Manners go a long way. Try to come from a good place. And aside from that, stay focused and do the right thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mmKuhn2K5sLzEs2SgqpGjsa6706Gcq2WUnrKleZBta3BrY2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./metallica-twitch-back-in-copyright-news-again.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Metallica, Twitch, Back In Copyright News Again</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stefan-lessard.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Stefan Lessard dating?
