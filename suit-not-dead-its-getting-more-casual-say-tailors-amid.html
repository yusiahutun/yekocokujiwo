Other Japanese clothing firms, such as Konaka and Haruyama Holdings, have been hit equally hard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/07/27/f96d4240-a6e4-4c22-8843-55fc5b366064_cec7db59.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, the Japanese government’s “cool biz” energy conservation drive, promoting cooler and more casual office wear, continues to dent the demand for tailored suits.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lockdowns and the shift to work from home, a coronavirus measure enthusiastically adopted by millions of office workers around the world, have driven the idea of chinos, jeans and even shorts and T-shirts as comfortable workwear.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Casual clothing giants like Uniqlo have seen sales soar this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once mostly worn for work-from-home Zoom meetings, casual wear is increasingly seen behind company office desks and in corporate meetings, even as parts of the world including the US and the UK take tentative steps away from social isolation measures.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘The man wearing a suit will be the new rebel’: work clothes’ post-virus vibe</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It remains to be seen how permanent the pandemic “dress casual” move will be as the world moves on.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Casual Fridays became Casual Everyday during the pandemic.

Various forms of the standard tailored business suit then held sway for decades, with an unfortunate segue into safari suits best forgotten. A century after the Great War, the disruption and mayhem of Covid-19 has ushered in a new age of relaxed dressing to suit an unsettled world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Still, Roshan Melwani, managing director of the famed Sam’s Tailor establishment in Tsim Sha Tsui, believes the sheer authority and address provided by a suit is not something that can be easily dismissed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/07/27/dbc16966-dfb6-4f91-a6df-996671d19b92_798e21ed.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sam’s Tailor has been operating since 1956 and has a list of celebrity clients – including US presidents such as Bill Clinton and politicians such as Sarah Palin, film stars such as Russell Crowe, singers such as Rod Stewart, and former tennis star Boris Becker.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The pandemic has curbed the travels of the rich and famous who once dropped by to be fitted for a bespoke suit or two at Sam’s in Tsim Sha Tsui, but Melwani says the store now offers a DIY online fitting service which works well, and if there’s any problem the garment can be returned and altered, with Sam’s picking up the courier costs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I get six, seven, eight Zoom calls from clients every day,” he says, sure the world will return to the tradition of tailored suits for everyday business meetings in the fullness of time. “Yes, the future is rosy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ho says that men’s business suits have evolved over the decades to flatter men’s physiques, to make chests look bigger, waists look smaller and to camouflage middle-age spread.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s widely accepted that portly men like former US president Donald Trump look far slimmer and more appealing in a business suit than they do in a golf shirt and jeans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even so, the clean lines of the formal business suit or lounge suit, with hard-edged lapels and sharp shoulders, are blurring and softening in the current age of casual wear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dean Cook, head of menswear buying at British fashion retailer Browns, says there will always be a demand for well-made tailored suits and separates, even if they’re worn without formal shirts and ties.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Browns has recently launched a made-to-measure tailoring service in partnership with Ermenegildo Zegna, and the retailer is concentrating on separates for a softer and more leisurely style.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We have noticed that the customers who always bought a suit from Zegna and Tom Ford are now buying separates from the same brands because they trust them,” Cook says. “The brands are also aware of this and have diversified their offer, appealing to a customer who is maybe working from home with the necessity for something smart but with a different aesthetic.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/07/27/d97aec7f-275d-4e02-90b0-2d6ae187a777_4c3bc3f2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Designers are looking to softer tailoring lines, travel suits and casual suits with more give that can be worn easily, Cook says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We saw a new direction when it comes to tailoring from the high fashion brands in refreshing colours during fashion week,” he says. “This was noticeable at [menswear trade show] Pitti, where we saw a lot of travel suits and casual suits that have more stretch and are easier to wear.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He adds that, in general, the trend in men’s suiting is for “less structured tailoring”, and notes that “comfort is now key”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/07/27/af2e2f5d-ab29-4053-aaca-f64a4642adb4_c049afe6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For his part, Melwani is adamant the formal suit is here to stay and he blames border restrictions rather than changing tastes for the current slump in tailoring.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The suit is still the king of men’s wardrobes, he says, and the demand for bespoke tailored clothing will come roaring back once pandemic restrictions are lifted and the world returns to life as normal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The suit is not dead, people have been saying that for many years, and it’s not dead,” he adds. “People still want to wear suits, they still wear suits.”</p><p class=postsid
