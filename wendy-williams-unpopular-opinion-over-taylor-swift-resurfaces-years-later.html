Her <a href=#>health</a> and life has been the topic of discussion this month following the release of a documentary on Lifetime. Producers filmed and spent time with the <a href=#>TV</a> star for several months after her talk show was cancelled. Some fans found it difficult to watch, with the <a href=#>celebrity</a> unable to remember certain names and places in certain scenes. Her family came out to announce the star had been diagnosed with aphasia and frontotemporal dementia ahead of the docu-series going on air. Now, a fan has shared a throwback video from her time on television, where Wendy Williams gave her unpopular opinion on <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wendy-williams-always-had-something-to-say-about-taylor-swift>Wendy Williams always had something to say about Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-840676146-1024x683.jpg><p>In the clip, which has gone viral with 15,000 views in a couple of days, shows <a href=#>Wendy Williams</a>‘ telling her audience about Taylor Swift.</p><p>Wendy explains, amid the drama between Tay Tay, <a href=#>Kanye West</a> and Kim Kardashian – we all know that one – she thinks the 34-year-old is the ‘mean one’. The former radio host claims the songwriter is also smarter than Kardashian and <a href=#>Beyonce</a> put together – which is a bit harsh.</p><p>But Wendy never shied from giving her true thoughts, whether in front of a mic or a camera.</p><p>It comes after <a href=#>Wendy Williams’ publicist, Shawn Zenotti</a>, spoke out yesterday over the docu-series.</p><p>She slammed the producers and claimed she only signed up the deal because she believed the show would be about her ‘big comeback’ they were trying to pull off, not her health.</p><p>Taylor is one of the biggest <a href=#>music</a> stars on the planet, so Wendy would talk about her a lot on the show.</p><p>She was making headlines before dating <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-am-done>‘I am done’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1564226733-2-1024x683.jpg><p>Wendy Williams said in one clip she was a ‘Swiftie’, but when she saw Taylor Swift not wearing much denim to gal pal’s <a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a>‘s denim-themed birthday party.</p><p>Before she would ever get into one of her rants, the TV star would also clarify, she’s a woman and is entitled to ‘change her mind’ if she wanted to. Which, she would do.</p><p>In another instance, when the Lover hitmaker was made New York City’s new welcome ambassador in 2014, Wendy wasn’t happy. Partly because she wasn’t a native to the iconic city or state, but also how she didn’t bring her Red tour to New York, instead choosing New Jersey.</p><p>It didn’t sit right with the star, who adores the city.</p><p>But it wasn’t always negative, she once compared Taylor with Katy Perry, and pointed out how Swift had seven <a href=#>Grammys</a> at the time, and her former friend didn’t. Awkward. This was at the time when the saga between the former friends was in the news.</p><p>Now, the star has 14 wins, so double that amount. This year, she made history as she took home Album Of The Year again, winning the gramophone four times in this category.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eGcMPEp5uyZaeeua21wKaqZq2epbyxwcuaqWanoJ67qrvNZqavnaJiwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1edGeqq6qlpawpr%2BMspyaqqNiuaLAxKtm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-carl-jung-helped-inspire-alcoholics-anonymous.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Carl Jung Helped Inspire Alcoholics Anonymous</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./savannah-guthrie-reveals-wardrobe-malfunction-128262.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Savannah Guthrie Reveals Wardrobe Malfunction</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
