As the song starts, Mac Miller acknowledges the significance of April 20th, also known as 4/20, a day synonymous with cannabis culture. He invites listeners to join him in celebrating this day by lighting up and immersing themselves in the world of smoking marijuana.Mac Miller introduces himself as an expert in the subject matter, focusing on the act of smoking rather than the music itself. He boasts about his skills in smoking weed and challenges anyone who thinks they can outsmoke his close associate TreeJ, wagering a considerable sum of money on TreeJ's ability to outshine any competition. This sets the tone for the song, highlighting the seriousness and dedication the artist holds for this topic.One standout lyric in the song states, "Still blowin' trees like a hurricane." Here, Mac Miller uses the metaphor of a hurricane to describe the intensity and frequency of his marijuana consumption. This lyric not only emphasizes his love for smoking, but it also conveys a sense of power and unstoppable force. By comparing himself to a hurricane, Mac Miller suggests that his dedication to smoking weed is unyielding and cannot be easily dismissed or ignored.Another noteworthy lyric is, "You used to smoke that dirt, you couldn't adjust. When you had to hit that kush, you were used to the bush like W. George." Through this lyric, Mac Miller cleverly references former President George W. Bush and contrasts the quality of marijuana. He alludes to the transition from smoking low-quality or "dirt" weed to experiencing the higher quality "kush." This lyric not only highlights Mac Miller's preference for better marijuana, but it also suggests a sense of growth and evolution in his appreciation for the plant.In one line, Mac Miller states, "Plus-size section with my blunt, that's a fat bitch." This line connects smoking weed to the concept of indulgence and pleasure. Mac Miller likens his blunt to a plus-size section clothing, emphasizing its size and abundance. This lyric showcases the artist's desire to fully enjoy the experience of smoking, as if he is indulging in something that brings him immense satisfaction and gratification.Mac Miller also references Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, beloved characters from the Looney Tunes cartoons, stating, "I’ll give him bars, and Bugs Bunny, and Daffy Duck." This lyric takes a more playful approach, incorporating nostalgia and humor into the song. By mentioning these characters, Mac Miller may be suggesting that smoking weed can transport individuals to a carefree and imaginative state, much like the world of cartoons.Throughout the song, Mac Miller weaves together these unexpected and imaginative themes to reinforce the overarching theme of celebrating marijuana culture and his personal experiences with smoking weed. Each lyric adds depth and complexity to the narrative, emphasizing different facets of the smoking experience. From power and intensity to growth and indulgence, Mac Miller invites listeners to join him in appreciating the art of smoking weed and the many dimensions it can bring to one's life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyurcJmpKKknJq%2FcLnEmqWippdivKd506GcZp%2BipMRuu89moKesoqR6o8WMppicZZ2eua2x0Q%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./surgeon-claims-thousands-men-need-27358170.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Surgeon claims 'thousands of men will need breast reductions' due to steroids</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./luke-maye.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Luke Maye</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
