The <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> player has seen his fame skyrocket even further after dating one of the most recognized people on the planet. But he earned his success before the celebrity couple went official last September. In a 2018 video, Travis explains he always wanted to be a quarterback, but it went downhill pretty quickly when he saw his chance. Chin up, Trav.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-s-childhood-dream-was-to-be-a-quarterback-not-a-tight-end>Travis Kelce’s childhood dream was to be a quarterback – not a tight end</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-1750745077-1024x683.jpg><p>In 2018, in a <a href=# rel=nofollow>video</a> ad linked with Snickers, he tells the camera: “So as a kid, I always dreamt of being an NFL quarterback.</p><p>“I remember being 10 years old and saying ‘Ma, I’m going to get you that house, I’m going to get you that car, and I’m going to throw football in the NFL and it’s going to be a <a href=#>touchdown</a>. It’ll be my first pass, everybody is going to love me'”.</p><p>“Everyone will love you because they love me,” he grins.</p><p>“Fast-forward to now, I’m unfortunately playing tight end – I guess I can’t really say unfortunately, but…”</p><p>“Still had that dream of throwing an <a href=#>NFL</a> pass, so my coach decides a play where I catch the ball, I fake like I’m running and I throw it to a wide receiver running down the field. When he designs this play, he tells me ‘I only have those options, either to throw it directly to this wide receiver, or this guy running down the middle of the field, or I run the ball’.</p><p>“He doesn’t want me scanning the field to try and find an open receiver.</p><p>“Because I’m not a quarterback,” he laughs.</p><p>But when it came to the final moments of the big game, he decides to follow his gut. It didn’t exactly go well.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-first-nfl-pass-became-his-last>‘His first NFL pass became his last’</h2><p>When the plan is being played out, the 34-year-old, brother to <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a>, decides it’s his chance.</p><p>He’s going to throw the ball, get a touchdown, make his mother (<a href=#>Donna Kelce</a>) proud, and Travis gets to live his childhood dream. But the rival team weren’t having it.</p><p>He explains: “We get to the game, and sure enough, it’s the fourth quarter, the heat of the battle and we’re down a touchdown. He calls the play, the quarterbacks snaps the ball throws it to me, I catch it, I act like I’m running, I look up and I see the wide receiver running down the field, it’s covered.</p><p>“I just happen to gander across the field to another wide receiver, little did he know, I was going to throw it. I knew I was about to chuck it at this point, it’s like bells going off in my head, like it’s dinner time.”</p><p>He throws the ball.</p><p>“One of the defenders from the other team comes running across the field and just ruins all of my dreams,” he says. “Interception on that play.</p><p>“I feel disappointment, like an idiot.”</p><p>We’re sure he’s not sour playing as tight end now.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2WBcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxKxknKCZobGpu86dZJ2qlZa6brXNZp%2Biq12kxK951qipnatdnbJuvsSao6WxXayur8DEnWStp12Xsm691JqprZ2il66kt44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rosette-fashion-trend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>16 Best Rosette Fashion Trend Accessories and Clothing of 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meghan-markle-j-crew-sale-black-friday-2023-8398993.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meghan Markle's Exact J.Crew Pieces Are Up to 50% Off for Cyber Week</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
