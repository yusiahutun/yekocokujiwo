As the episodes aired, Rose took to X to basically call Mary a hypocrite, tweeting at one point, "I cannot sit and listen to this evil and mean woman talk about growth OMFG."</p><p>Explaining her tweet, Whitney said, "It's hard because I feel like I personally put in so much work into myself, I spent thousands of dollars in therapy. I've been making a conscious effort to be a better person. So to see you talk about us that way, to see what you would say in your confessionals ... "</p><p>"So you're saying what you're saying, cursing and tweeting me is growth?" Mary interjected, before Whitney said she never would have said anything had Mary not posted about her on social media first.</p><p>"I didn't tweet anything about you. I just said you were racist," Cosby then said, without hesitation. "I said you're racist. Yeah."</p><p>The tweet in question was in response to Whitney allegedly hanging out with short-lived costar Jennie Nguyen after <a href=#><strong>Jennie was fired from the show</strong></a> following backlash for resurfaced Facebook posts in opposition to the Black Lives Matters movement.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This tells me whitney is Racist too!</p>â€” Mary Cosby (@Mary_M_Cosby) <a href=#>September 23, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@Mary_M_Cosby</a><p>A stunned <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> asked Mary, "You believe Whitney's racist?" -- before she responded, "I do. 100%. I do."</p><p>The jaws on all the women in the room dropped, with Whitney looking especially shocked. "That breaks my heart," Rose said, before Cohen asked Mary what her feelings were "based" on.</p><p>"What they were brought up in, the religion," she said, referring to the Mormon church.</p><p>"I believe they have their beliefs ... that our color is cursed by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>color of Cain</strong></a> and we will be in a different heaven, our skin color will be in a different heaven and we'll be the help," Cosby continued.</p><p>While Barlow -- a current Mormon -- asked if she could speak up, Heather Gay -- an ex-Mormon -- said the church's doctrine "is rooted in racism," saying "the Mormon church today is making efforts on every level to outreach." She added, "But we have to acknowledge it in order to change it."</p><p>Whitney agreed with Heather's words, while Barlow looked stunned and pointed out that former Utah Jazz player Thurl Bailey is "Black and Mormon."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dc151b7a-4a97-4b35-893c-730b56687af4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3f4e0fa4-9671-43e0-95ca-baa759f06f9a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/de/5by4/2023/12/20/de477d053fb64dd2b06165d5d960339b_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lisa Barlow's Son Jack Hospitalized While Serving Mormon Mission in Colombia</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I just want Mary to know, because that's a big accusation to make and I am no longer a member of the Mormon church and that was part of my process," Whitney then told Mary, &nbsp;who said she didn't have anything personal against the Mormon church, its followers and their beliefs and only wished "we could just leave them alone."</p><p>As Whitney then began to acknowledge her own white privilege, Cosby interjected, "Go ahead, preach it, Whitney! You've been saying some good things lately, I have to say that. Go ahead, girl."</p><p>Rose then asked, "What have I done or said to you?"</p><p>"It's not anything you do or say, it's your actions, it's a feeling and you have to be my color to know it," she replied, with Whitney calling that comment "fair." Mary then added, "It's not something anyone can teach you, it's not anything anyone can tell you."</p><p>The conversation ended with Whitney wanting to make it clear as crystal that she hadn't "said or done anything personally to you of that nature" -- with Mary responding, "No."</p><p>The episode concluded with Mary chiming in on <a href=#><strong>Monica Garcia's Reality von Tease controversy,</strong></a> with Cosby believing the reaction from the other women was a bit overdramatic. They then attempted to get her on their side by playing audio they claimed was of Monica calling Mary a "dumb bitch," but Mary said she believed they weren't giving Garcia any space to talk and they had to "hear her out."</p><p>The final installment of the 3-part reunion airs next Tuesday on Bravo.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3778e050-5fb3-454d-a53c-4d19d1049788 data-container-ref=toofab:article:3f4e0fa4-9671-43e0-95ca-baa759f06f9a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/41/5by4/2023/09/13/41b98e6d54e44c88a89f05d69c5c24b9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">RHOSLC Star Monica Garcia Reveals the Shocking Reason She Was Excommunicated From Mormon Church</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmam5fp7Wwv8ucZKudpaO2sLqMppirsV2YvLSu2GauoaGko7K6edGoqp5lopawqr%2FTaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-high-waisted-jeans.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 19 Best High-Waisted of 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kris-humphries-speaks-out-about-kim-kardashian-nude-photo-shoot.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian's Ex Kris Humphries Speaks Out About Her Nude Photo Shoot</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./entertainment.html>Entertainment News: K-pop, Hip Hop, Netflix, Movies &amp;amp; TV</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princeton-tigers-win-69-66-at-mendota-sectional.html>Princeton Tigers win 69-66 at Mendota Sectional</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./mens-sneaker-trends-2024.html>Skater Shoes &amp;amp; 14 Styles To Own The Year</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meghan-markle-clevr-blends.html>We Found a Meghan Markle-Approved Way to Fall Asleep Easier</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./what-does-it-mean-to-dream-about-a-mountain-that-glows-at-night.html>What does it mean to dream about A mountain that glows at night</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeDash.
