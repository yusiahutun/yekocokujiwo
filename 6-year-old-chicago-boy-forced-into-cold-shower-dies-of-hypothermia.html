The sister claimed that she had had a number of drinks at the party and fell asleep, and that when she woke up, both the man and her little brother had disappeared.</p><p>Prosecutors now call that version of events "completely false."</p><p>In a court hearing Sunday, Lake County Assistant State's Attorney Kyle Doyle said the little boy "did something that the mother felt needed to be punished for"; the following day he was put into a cold shower for an "extended period of time."</p><p>Damari vomited and became unresponsive, and eventually died, Doyle said. But nobody in the family called 911 for medical assistance.</p><p>Instead, Damari's mother and brother discussed what to do with the body, driving it to Indiana to dump and burn before inventing the party story, the prosecutor claimed.</p><p>According to the Lake County Coroner's Office, Damari's body was found with bruising on his legs, with an "extremely cold core temperature, and partially frozen internal organs," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC Chicago</a> reported. The body also showed "postmortem thermal injury/charring", showing someone had attempted to burn the corpse.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:aec5fe0b-aba9-4fdd-8527-8949622c2a62 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2c20736b-6cda-4c69-92e8-607e6356e5ae data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d0/5by4/2022/01/07/d0d2467e623b443cbae1a99cfe6f350a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Manchester NH Police</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Harmony Montgomery Was Homeless and Living in Car With Father When She Vanished, Police Claim as They Narrow Down Timeline</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Jannie Parry was charged with first-degree murder, concealment of a homicidal death and obstructing justice.</p><p>Jeremiah Perry was charged with aggravated battery causing great bodily harm to a child under 12, concealing a homicidal death, and obstructing justice.</p><p>A second juvenile sibling was also arrested for charges related to concealing the boy's body; because of their age, their identity has not been released.</p><p>The mother was due to appear in court in Sunday, but was taken to hospital in police custody instead after complaining she was ill.</p><p>On Wednesday she was discharged back to court, where she was ordered held on a $5million bond.
